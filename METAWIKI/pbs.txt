Pearls Before Swine tests (pretty much redoing this to be specific to PeBeSw)

Guidelines for editing this file:

  - Character names are given as "name (species)", eg "Leah (zebra)",
  without any relations (eg, not "Aunt Leah").

  - Exceptions: Well-known characters use just their first names (like
  "Larry") with a separate species indicator (eg,
  "Larry::species::crocodile")

  - If two characters have both the same name and species (eg, the
  crocodiles named Bob), this is given as "Bob 20101015 (crocodile)"
  where 2010-10-15 is the date they first appeared. I'm not crazy
  about this convention, but it beats "Bob 2 (crocodile)" because I'd
  have to update the order every time I found a new Bob between two
  existing Bobs. I may have the program simply re-name these in order
  when found.

  - If a character is referred to by reference (eg, "Neighbor Joe"),
  the name is still Joe, with "Rat+Pig::neighbor::Joe (human)" for
  example. Additionally, "Joe (human)::aka::Neighbor Joe".

  - If the character name indicates a profession (eg, "Cobbler Bob"),
  you can also add "Bob (human)::profession::cobbler".

  - for _deaths keys, use "#4" to indicate 4 deaths above and beyond
  named character deaths (can't use "+" because that already means two
  or more keys/values)

  - use &#58; for colons in text

TODO (global todo's not specific to a given strip):

  - Why are MULTIREF30.mw and MULTIREF43.mw being created?

  - MULTIREFs should be mentioned on strip pages

  - Read * comments I put in CHARLIST

  - Character list should include species, subspecies, profession, and
  maybe aliases

  - On character list, links should open in new tabs

  - Find a more general way to create templates

  - Strip page should include "continuity issues"

  - Transcribe 2003-11-09 album titles (no Easter eggs though)

  - Characters that appear 0 times are probably mistakes

  - Why is there no Bob (crocodile) #05?

  - At some point, need to delete pages that no longer exist

  - Should strip pages say "Rat (515th appearance of 917 to date)" or
  something?

  - Character pages should include character notes and description

  - Consider redoing continuity/multiref pages as list not paragraph

  - Pig + Rat's human neighbors automatically "::aka::Neighbor x"?

  - Distinguish between storylines and characters: for example, Atlas
  is currently both (character_is_storyline::1, but then need to
  decide on which template to use?)

  - Character multiple deaths/rebirths currently not handled properly

  - Make sure characters like Bippy, Pigita, Jef are synchronous (or
  nearly so) with their storylines

  - "deaths" should only show when there actually is one (Character template)

  - Bob (human) 21 should have alias Neighbor Bob, but does not

  - Consider using "hovertext" ("a title") to show notes for
  thumbnailed strips (currently doing this, but consider if I want to
  keep it)

  - Use limited transitivity for sanity checking; eg, if
  "source::kills::target", make sure target has death date
  
  - Commas in descriptions (like for "Dingo Boy") are creating <br> 
  where not needed (try &#44; instead?)

  - Make sure most links open in new page/tab

  - Longest gap between appearances = interesting?

  - Currently "character" means a character appearance or
  mention/reference. Consider distinguishing this further:
  on-camera/off-camera role, speaking/non-speaking role, reference
  only, implicit reference (eg, referenced because of storyline, but
  not directly involved in specific strip)

  - Consider making the first appearance of a "major" character (one
  that appears more than 20 times?) an "event"

  - Pages referenced by MULTIREF should have a backlink to the MULTIREF page

  - Insure semantic triples inside MULTIREF are parsed and processed

  - In a source relation target triple, source and target should never
  be identical

  - Consider (loosely) annotating on a panel-by-panel basis, not just
  strip-by-strip

  - Consider special format for Characters page if character has only
  one appearance

  - If I don't create individual character pages, consider using "a
  name" to link between characters

  - Do more error checking on date ranges (eg, first-last where last < first)

  - Maybe create a "Species Death" dropdown with all "deaths" pages listed, perhaps in order of number of deaths

  - Consider error-checking where I have "Fred 1" (and there's only
  one Fred) or "Fred (human)" (when there are no other characters
  named Fred, regardless of species)

  - Check for things like "Name 12345678" as erroneous version of
  "Name 12345678 (species)"

  - Consider transcluding or interwiki linking to existing PBS wiki on
  wikia (harder if I'm on referata though?)

  - Consider including anonymous characters, but perhaps only "important" ones

  - Vette character list, especially for characters who appear 2-3
  times, to make sure I haven't combined characters

  - Find a better way of determining which entities (source/v values)
  are characters (eg, anything with any sort of relative, but perhaps
  more explicit)

  - Include thumbnails for Get Fuzzy strips where Get Fuzzy parallels PBS

  - Disclaim that all info is based on gocomics.com site (not
  newspaper comics) and that I make mistakes and data is incomplete

  - Use CSS (or just program) to remind people not to edit wiki
  directly (however, referata.com enforces this anyway)

  - Sanity check: most characters should not die more than once

  - Include "fair use" disclaimer for thumbnails (gocomics.com is
  aware I am using these, but does not approve)

  - Decide what [[foo::bar::A+B+C+D]] should return (comma-separated list?)

  - wp template (wikipedia) not working on wikia.com version

  - Try to find more PBS transcripts, above/beyond the ones I've already found

  - Ask IPL (for example) "in which PBS strips has Pig appeared"
  and/or how to do this kind of research in general

  - Make sure my list of GIFs is complete, except for missing 7 days
  or so that isn't even on gocomics.com site

  - On newspapers page, note that some newspapers are
  fictious/generic, not always papers in which PBS appears

  - Look into ListWidget to show semantic queries better

  - Lenny species = dog, not labrador (program error)

  - Tim (human) #03 should not be a self-alias

  - Error check: 8 numbers in name, but not species?

  - Link storylines together when they relate to each other or flow into each other

Computer program jobs (what the computer program is supposed to do):

  - assign classes to each source/target (eg, character, strip, alias, etc)

  - if source/target is an alias, replace with character (except 'aka')

  - assign character species from "name (species)" where not already assigned

  - replace character names with dates (eg, "foo 20010101
  (crocodile)") with numbered names ("foo (crocodile0 #1")

  - bidirectionally rewrite relationships (like brother, father,
  mother, sister) so that 'relation' is 'relative' not 'brother'

  - For characters that are storylines, create additional triples

  - First appearance/death of "major" character is an event (TODO: can
  this be divined semantically, and should it be?)

  - Error check: use of "foo 20010101 (crocodile)" unneeded if only
  one foo (crocodile)

  - Error check: all sources/targets must have EXACTLY ONE class

  - Error check: all characters must have EXACTLY ONE species (zero or
  multiple subspecies ok)

  - Error check: all date names ("foo 20010101") should have a species
  indicator

  - Error check: all date names ("foo 20010101") first appearance
  should be their name

  - Error check: everything in class 'character' must appear in at
  least one strip

# Notes:

pages that link to [[Pig]] = Pig's appearances and mentions
[[x::y]] automatically links to y
Talk::x special format for talk pages
zebra_deaths:: -> category::Zebra deaths
Angry Bob -> category::Rat writes???
Family circus mention/Dilbert mention -> Other comic strip mention?
husband -> relative
multiple story lines in one strip
hyperlinks on all date pages
aka == redirect?

Not suitable for some readers who prefer 75 year-old strips drawn by the son of the son of the son of the original creator. Product not available in some cities where `Snuffy Smith' still wins reader polls. Product may have limited availability in cities where editors choose comic strips based solely upon potential social or demographic appeal. Check local listings. No animals were harmed in the making of this strip, although we roughed up the dumb pig a little bit. Our apologies to the editors throughout North America who are staying up late tonight perusing this text with a magnifying glass to ensure that this cartoonist did not bury any offending words or concepts in this text. Okay... I'm tired now. To be perfectly frank, when I initially came up with this `tiny word' joke, I thought it would be really quick to do, but I now see that to make this joke work, the writing has to be really small, and it takes a ton of tiny words to fill such a large space. Hence, I have run out of ideas. If you'd like, you can now move on to `Cathy' or `B.C.'And check in on their crazy antics, as I am totally out of funny stuff. Actually, so are they. So heck, maybe you ought to put this newspaper down and watch a little TV. Geez, man, I STILL have more space to fill with this now tired joke. What to do... what to do... I suppose that a lesser cartoonist would use this space to promote his latest books, but I don't think that either of my two books, `BLTs taste so darn good' or `This little piggy stayed home', both pf which were published by Andrews McMeel publishing need that sort of cheap publicity. Their sales at Borders, Barnes & Nobles, Amazon.com and your local bookstore have been tremendous and they don't need more help from me here. Wow, finally... I'm done. I'm never doing this joke again"]]

And the label is pretty great too. And it comes in those handy little cardboard six-packs that have those little handles on them that make the beer easier to carry around. And if you buy the beer, you'll probably make more friends because that's just the kind of beer it is. So that's about all I have to say about Danny Donkey beer, except for the fact that it goes really good with chips, pretzels, crackers, cheese, pizza, burritos, tacos, pasta, hamburgers, and hot dogs. I really like hot dogs. It also goes really well with my friend Stephan's blog. You should read it. It's at www.stephanpastis.wordpress.com. Or even better, go be one of his friends on Facebook. His Facebook page is http://www.facebook.com/pages/Stephan-Pastis/132583843763?created. Stephan's a pretty good guy. I'd promote his books too, but I'm probably getting pretty far from my original topic, that being Danny Donkey beer, which tastes really great and is less filling. So if you want to be(COVERED) and have lots of friends and have all the girls like you, drink Da(COVERED)and you'll never regret it. Take care and have a nice day (COVERED) driving on this fine morning, or afternoon, or night, or (COVERED) maybe."]]

On [[2003-10-31]], one of his charades guesses is cheese (another guess, "monkey", also appears to be an object of fascination for Pig). On [[2004-05-07]], he refers to (and is fascinated by) a grater as "cheese grater" (even though it can grate many other things). On [[2007-05-23]], he invents "cheese sneakers". On [[2009-01-07]], Rat designs a building made of cheese (which Pig says could be "hard to build"), an indirect reference.  On [[2010-08-07]], he (and Rat) are obsessed with free cheese samples. On [[2011-05-02]], Pig describes his cheese's expiration date as an "event". On [[2012-05-11]], we learn that Pig visit a speciality cheese store (possible nod to Monty Python here). On [[2012-06-18]], Pig obtains a new grater, which he again uses to grate (shred) some cheese. On [[2013-03-06]], we learn that Pig regularly eats fried cheese sticks, cheeseburgers, and chili cheese fries. On [[2014-04-07]], he tells Pigita he prefers eating cheese over shelter.]]

On [[2002-11-17]], his mother calls him a "monkeybrain". On [[2003-01-24]], similarly to 2002-09-27, another fortune cookie tells Pig he will be "monkey food". On [[2003-10-31]], one of Pig's charades guesses is "monkey" (another is "cheese", another item that appears to fascinate pig). On [[2004-01-28]], Pig talks about egging monkeys. The reference appears to be coincidental, but may have deeper meaning. On [[2006-12-16]], Pig gets a "security monkey" (perhaps assuming a toy monkey is safe despite the earlier fortune cookie warnings). On [[2008-05-09]], Rat sends Pig a telegram via monkey (again somewhat coincidental, though possibly Rat's attempt to scare Pig). On [[2009-06-30]], Pig wears monkey underwear (the monkey looks curiously like {{wp|Curious George}}). On [[2009-09-20]], Pig orders a monkey-in-a-box (he's apparently gotten over the fortune cookie warnings). On [[2009-10-13]], he dresses up as a [[Pig::aka::Monkeypig]]. On [[2010-07-20]], he wears monkey pajama bottoms as "magic pants" (which look virtually identical to his monkey underwear from 2009-06-30). On [[2012-02-09]], he wants to groom [[Pigita]] "just like monkeys" (again, possibly just an incidental reference). On [[2012-10-06]], he refers to a chimp as his friend. On [[2013-07-20]], he takes ice cream "as a gibbon". Of course, chimps and gibbons are apes, not monkeys (as my favorite Librarian would be quick to remind me), but it's in the same general theme.]]

On [[2011-10-22]], he notes that he *has* been awesome for at least 30 days in a row. This isn't necessarily a contradiction: it's possible that Rat's awesomeness doesn't make him happy and/or that Rat was just having a bad month in March]]

MULTIREF [[title::Pig's Uncle George (pig)]] [[notes::On [[2004-12-05]], Uncle George appears as a sausage link; on [[2011-02-18]], he appears as a package of bacon (maybe it's two different Uncle Georges, or different parts of the same Uncle George?)]]

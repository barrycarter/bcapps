      WE HAD A GREAT SPOT,
 NOT EASY TO FIND, BUT WORTH IT.
          BUT WITH COPD
   MAKING IT HARD TO BREATHE,
            I THOUGHT
    THOSE DAYS MIGHT BE OVER.

          SO MY DOCTOR
      PRESCRIBED SYMBICORT.

    SYMBICORT DOESN'T REPLACE

      SYMBICORT IS FOR COPD
  INCLUDING CHRONIC BRONCHITIS
         AND EMPHYSEMA.

     IT SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN
     MORE THAN TWICE A DAY.
SYMBICORT MAY INCREASE YOUR RISK
       OF LUNG INFECTIONS,
          OSTEOPOROSIS,
     AND SOME EYE PROBLEMS.

        TELL YOUR DOCTOR
  IF YOU HAVE A HEART CONDITION
     OR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE
        BEFORE TAKING IT.
      WITH COPD, I THOUGHT
 I'D MISS OUR FAMILY TRADITION.

   NOW SYMBICORT SIGNIFICANTLY
   IMPROVES MY LUNG FUNCTION,
   STARTING WITHIN 5 MINUTES.
   AND THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE
        IN MY BREATHING.

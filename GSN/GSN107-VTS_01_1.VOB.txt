           DID YOU KNOW
       THAT IN OLD MOVIES

 MARRIED COUPLES WERE REQUIRED
   TO SLEEP IN SEPARATE BEDS?
  AND YOU THOUGHT IT WAS HARD
 TO GET YOUR WIFE IN THE MOOD.
           [laughter]

 HERE ARE TONIGHT'S NEWLYWEDS!
       [cheers, applause]
      SHE'S A VEGETARIAN,
         AND HE IS NOT,

          SO DINNER IS
     THE AGE-OLD QUESTION--
    TO MEAT, OR NOT TO MEAT?
    HERE'S MARC AND DOREEN.

       AND SHE CALLS HIM
       "SOUTHERN COMFORT"
          BECAUSE HE'S
 A PERFECT SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN.
    SORRY, BUT ON THIS SHOW
    A GENTLEMAN DOES TELL.

   WELCOME ALMASI AND SARAH.
            - WHOO!
- WHEN THEY FIRST MET AT A CLUB,
    SHE TOLD HIM TO GET LOST.

    MEN. THEY NEVER LISTEN.
      MEET DAVE AND ERICA.

            FELLAS,
      HOW ARE YOU TONIGHT?

           all: GOOD.
      - HOW ARE YOU DOING?
        - OH, VERY GOOD.
   DEEP VOICES. YOU'RE READY.
          - OH, YEAH.

       - SO WE HAVE SENT
      YOUR WIVES BACKSTAGE
       SO WE CAN ASK YOU
        SOME QUESTIONS.
    LET'S GET RIGHT INTO IT.

   GENTLEMEN, WHEN YOUR WIFE
        IS ON TOP OF YOU
   PLAYING THE ADULT VERSION
        OF HORSEY-HORSEY
          WENT TO TOWN,

  WHERE ARE YOUR FRONT HOOVES
        USUALLY LOCATED?
       ON HER SADDLEBAGS,
     ON HER HIND QUARTERS,

      OR BEHIND YOUR HEAD
        WHILE YOU RELAX
      AND ENJOY THE RIDE?
             - HMM.
             - MARC.

     - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
         BEHIND MY HEAD.
          RELAX WHILE
       I ENJOY THE RIDE.
         - OH, REALLY?

        - I ENJOY MYSELF
          AT NIGHTTIME.
          I WORK HARD
        DURING THE DAY,
    AND I FIGURE, YOU KNOW,

      LET HER DO THE, UH,
         THE HARD WORK.
        - SO SHE DOES
    THE HEAVY LIFTING, HUH?
         - SHE'S GOOD.
         - ALL RIGHT.

     - SHE DOES A GOOD JOB.
           - ALMASI,
        WHAT DO YOU SAY?
  - I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO WITH,
    UH, ON THE HIND QUARTERS.

    - ON THE HIND QUARTERS.
         - DEFINITELY.
         BECAUSE THAT'S
      WHERE I LIKE TO BE.
           YOU KNOW,
    THAT'S MY FAVORITE PART.

           [laughter]
    NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,
     I PLAN ON BEING THERE
     AT THE END OF THE DAY.

           [laughter]
    - DAVE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
     - UH, I'M GONNA SAY
 DEFINITELY ON THE SADDLEBAGS.

            - YEAH?
 - I MEAN, THEY'RE RIGHT THERE.
    LIKE, HOW CAN YOU NOT--
        HOW COULD YOU NOT?
     - HOW COULD YOU NOT?

    - ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN,
          NEXT QUESTION.
           WHEN YOU
     FIRST STARTED DATING,
     WHAT WAS THE ONE THING
         ABOUT YOUR WIFE

  THAT TOOK JUST A LITTLE BIT
       OF GETTING USED TO?
            ALMASI.
 - I'M GONNA GO WITH HER LACK
 OF CLEANING UP AFTER HERSELF.

            - YEAH.
   - IT TAKES A LITTLE WHILE
       TO GET USED TO IT.
            - OKAY.
     WHAT ABOUT YOU, DAVE?

  - MY WIFE MELTS AT THE DOOR
       WHEN SHE COMES HOME.
       I MEAN, COAT OFF,
         BAG, SHOES...
          IT'S LIKE--
  LOOKS LIKE FROSTY WAS THERE.

           [laughter]
   IT'S INSANE, IT'S INSANE.
         - OKAY. MARC.
         - I THINK THAT
       SHE WAS VERY NEAT,

          AND I'M NOT,
     SO IT WAS KIND OF HARD
        TO GET USED TO
       HAVING SOMEBODY
    BE A LITTLE BIT MORE...

   - PICKING UP AFTER YOU...
    - CLEANER THAN ME. YUP.
        - ALL THE TIME.
           ALL RIGHT.
       HUSBANDS, THIS IS
      OUR FINAL QUESTION.

    IF A CHEERLEADING SQUAD
      WANTED TO SPELL OUT
       THE DIRTIEST WORD
 YOUR WIFE USES IN THE BEDROOM,
   THEY'D KICK OFF THE CHEER
          BY SHOUTING,

       "GIVE ME A BLANK!"
             DAVE.
         - OH, MY LORD.

 I'M DEFINITELY GETTING SMACKED
     FOR THIS ONE, BUT, UH...
          - ALL RIGHT.
       - GIVE ME AN "F."
    - WE LIKE SMACKING HERE.

          - HEY, NOW.
        GIVE ME AN "F."
       - GIVE ME AN "F."
       I WILL DEARLY PAY
         FOR THAT ONE.

          - ALL RIGHT.
      - I WILL DEARLY PAY
            - MARC,
      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?

      - I KNOW HER PARENTS
  ARE GONNA BE WATCHING THIS.
    SHE'S NOT GONNA BE HAPPY
        ABOUT THIS, BUT...
      - HI, MOM. HI, DAD.

     - SHE'D PROBABLY SAY,
       "GIVE ME A SMACK."
  - OKAY, SO WE WANT A LETTER.
        - A LETTER? OH.
        GIVE ME AN "S."

       - GIVE ME AN "S."
           ALL RIGHT.
            ALMASI.
  - I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO WITH,
       UH, THE "F" AGAIN,

     JUST BECAUSE--I MEAN,
THERE'S A LOT OF OPTIONS THERE.
       - YEAH, THERE ARE.
             - YEAH.
     - BUT I THINK THERE'S
 A COUPLE THAT START WITH "F,"

     SO I'LL GO WITH THAT.
         - YEAH. OKAY.
        YOU GO WITH "F."
 GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
            NICE JOB.

       I HOPE YOUR WIVES
    CAN MATCH YOUR ANSWERS,
       BECAUSE THE COUPLE
      WITH THE MOST POINTS
     AT THE END OF THE GAME

      WILL WIN A FANTASTIC
        SECOND HONEYMOON

          AND, LADIES,
      WHILE YOU WERE GONE,
     I ASKED YOUR HUSBANDS
        THREE QUESTIONS.
     AND NOW IT'S YOUR JOB
TO TRY AND MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.

      EACH CORRECT ANSWER
      IS WORTH 5 POINTS.
      HERE WE GO, LADIES.
       WHEN YOU'RE ON TOP
        OF YOUR HUSBAND

   PLAYING THE ADULT VERSION
        OF HORSEY-HORSEY
          WENT TO TOWN,
   WHERE DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY

        HIS FRONT HOOVES
      ARE USUALLY LOCATED?
      ON YOUR SADDLEBAGS,
     ON YOUR HIND QUARTERS,

       OR BEHIND HIS HEAD
        WHILE HE RELAXES
      AND ENJOYS THE RIDE?
            DOREEN.

    - I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY
          HIND QUARTERS.
             - MM.
            - YEAH.
          - ALL RIGHT,
    MARC, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

        BEHIND HIS HEAD
       WHILE HE RELAXES.
             - OH!
    - COME ON, YOU KNOW ME.
         - WHAT ARE YOU
         TALKING ABOUT?

   - I LIKE TO ENJOY MYSELF.
         - OH, MY GOD.
     - RELAX A LITTLE BIT.
- SO HE'S JUST BASICALLY SAYING
     HE WANTS TO KICK BACK

      AND WATCH YOU WORK.
       - I SEE HOW IT IS.
           - [laughs]
    - ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

    - SARAH, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
    - I'M DEFINITELY GONNA
 HAVE TO SAY THE HIND QUARTERS.
      - THE HIND QUARTERS?
            - YEAH.

  - THAT'S HIS FAVORITE PART.
             SO...
          - ALL RIGHT.
    ALMASI, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

             - HMM.
    - ON THE HIND QUARTERS!
           - WHOO! YAY!
   - YEAH, GIVE ME SOME. AH!

     WELL DONE, WELL DONE.
      - ALL RIGHT, ERICA,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
      - UH, I'M GONNA ALSO
     GO WITH HIND QUARTERS.

         IT SEEMS TO BE
    A FAVORITE AREA OF HIS.
    - OKAY. THE HIND QUARTERS.
      WHAT DID YOU SAY, DAVE?
            HE SAID
       ON THE SADDLEBAGS.

    - WE DID IT LAST NIGHT.
   - NO, YOU'RE [indistinct].

          - ALL RIGHT,
  SO I'M ASSUMING LAST NIGHT--
     WAS IT THE SADDLEBAGS,
  OR WAS IT THE HIND QUARTERS?
       - IT WAS, IT WAS.
    - IT WAS THE SADDLEBAGS?

        - DON'T WORRY.
 HE'S NOT GONNA DO THAT AGAIN.
      - OH! WELL, JUST TRY
 A LITTLE SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
         NEXT QUESTION.

           WHEN YOU
     FIRST STARTED DATING,
   WHAT DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY
  WAS THE ONE THING ABOUT YOU
  THAT TOOK JUST A LITTLE BIT
       OF GETTING USED TO?

             SARAH.
      - PROBABLY MY, LIKE,
          CLEANLINESS.
        NOT BEING VERY--

        LIKE, PICKING UP
         AFTER MYSELF,
          LEAVING CUPS
      ALL OVER THE HOUSE...
          - ALL RIGHT.
  - THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE IT.

   - ALMASI, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
          - GOOD ANSWER.
     - HE SAID THE LACK OF
  CLEANING UP AFTER YOURSELF.
            - YEAH.
            - YUP.

           - NO WAY!
   - THAT'S RIGHT. YEAH WAY!
            [laughs]
       ALL RIGHT, ERICA,
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?

     - HE IS OCD-ORGANIZED,
         AND I'M A MESS,
    AND HE CAN'T HANDLE IT.
    - OKAY. WHAT'D YOU SAY?

 - I SAID YOU MELT AT THE DOOR.
    - YOU MELT AT THE DOOR.
           - OH, WELL,
    THAT'S TAKING STUFF OFF.
           I'M A MESS.
         I DROP THINGS.

          both: OHH...
       - YEAH, I'M SORRY.
        - IT'S THE SAME.
        - FIRED. FIRED.
      - ALL RIGHT, DOREEN,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?

    - I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY
THE FACT THAT I'M A VEGETARIAN.
            - YEAH.
   - 'CAUSE I DON'T EAT MEAT,
            AND HE'S
    A BIG MEAT-EATER MAYBE.

 - OH, WOW. HOW DOES THAT WORK
        IN YOUR FAMILY?
    - I'M ALL RIGHT WITH IT.
I MEAN, HE COOKS HIS OWN STUFF,
      AND, UH, IT'S GOOD.

   HE DOESN'T WANT ME COOKING
     ANYTHING WITHOUT MEAT.
        - THAT'S HOW YOU
      GET OUT OF COOKING--
         JUST GO, "YEAH,
 I DON'T EAT MEAT. I'M SORRY."

    - EXACTLY. I DON'T KNOW
        HOW TO COOK IT.
             - OKAY,
     WHAT'D YOU SAY, MARC?
       YOU'RE VERY NEAT.

           - [sighs]
- THAT'S A GOOD ANSWER, THOUGH.
       I GOTTA TELL YOU.
 - YEAH, THAT'S A GREAT ANSWER.
      - I MEAN, IT'S TOUGH
      WHEN YOU LIKE MEAT.

            - BABE.
          - ALL RIGHT,
    FINAL QUESTION, LADIES.

           ALL RIGHT,
     WHAT'D YOU SAY, DAVE?
             - "W"?
       - GIVE ME AN "F."

         - WHAT IS "W"?
        - YOU'RE GONNA
        MAKE ME SAY IT?

   - I WANNA KNOW WHAT IT IS.
   - WOULD YOU PLEASE SAY IT?
      - THE DIRTIEST WORD,
    I WOULD SAY, IS "WHORE."

            all: OH!
     - OKAY. YOU GO, GIRL!
            - WHOA!

           - WHAT?
       [cheers, applause]
         - WHO ARE YOU?
    - THAT'S A GOOD ANSWER.

          - WHO ARE YOU?
   - APPARENTLY WE JUST MET.
     IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.
           [laughter]

       - I WOULD SAY "F."
             - "F."
            - YEAH.
   - THE "F" WORD. ALL RIGHT.

              "S."
             - "S."
    - WANNA KNOW WHAT "S"...
          - FOR SMACK.

           - [laughs]
              OKAY.
          - [laughs]
    SARAH, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
        - I'M DEFINITELY
       GONNA GO WITH "F."

      - ALL RIGHT, ALMASI,

       We have product X
     and we have  product Y.
   We are going to start with
           product X.

   The only thing I'll let you
    know is  that it is an,
      affordable product.
        Oh, I like that.

  Let's move on to product Y,
 which is a far more expensive
            product.
 Whoaaa. I don't care for that
            at all.

             Yuck.
    You picked X and it was
      GEICO car insurance
   and Y was the competitor.

  Is that something you would
    pay for year after year?
 I, I like soda a lot but for a
        change of pace...
WOW! WHO DELIVERED THESE
PIZZA DIPPING STRIPS?

       OH, THEY'RE NOT DELIVERY.

       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
    IT'S YOUR TURN TO ANSWER
        A FEW QUESTIONS,
      AND THESE NEXT THREE
   ARE WORTH 10 POINTS EACH.

         ARE YOU READY?
            - READY.
    - ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.
    IF I ASKED YOUR HUSBAND

      ABOUT HIS VERY FIRST
       SEXUAL EXPERIENCE,
          WOULD HE BE
  MOST EMBARRASSED TO TELL ME
   WHO, WHAT, WHERE, OR WHEN?

            DOREEN.
       - UM, I'M PROBABLY
         GONNA SAY WHEN,
        BECAUSE I'M SURE
  IT WAS AT A VERY YOUNG AGE,

    AND HE PROBABLY DOESN'T
     WANT ME TO KNOW THAT.
     - DO YOU HAVE AN IDEA?
          - FOURTEEN.
            - OKAY.

    - I'M GUESSING, THOUGH.
          - ALL RIGHT.
             SARAH.
       - PROBABLY WHERE.

            - WHERE.
            - YEAH.
        BECAUSE HE LOVES
    ANYTHING IN THE PUBLIC,
         AND SO I'M SURE
    THAT COULD BE SOMETHING

         THAT HAPPENED
     THE FIRST TIME, SO...
         - OKAY. ERICA.
     - I'M GONNA SAY WHEN,

      BECAUSE IT PROBABLY,
          AGAIN, WAS--
  GUYS--A LITTLE BIT YOUNGER,
          SO MAYBE WHEN.
   - OKAY. THIS NEXT QUESTION
IS FROM OUR FASHIONABLE FRIENDS

           AT MACY'S.
COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE, LADIES.
   IF MY HUSBAND HAD HIS WAY,

   HE'D WEAR HIS BLANK 24/7.
             SARAH.
      - HIS FOOTBALL GEAR.
       HE LOVES FOOTBALL.

         - OKAY. ERICA.
      - HE'S REALLY, LIKE,
  A WHITE T-SHIRT KIND OF GUY.
           - MM-HMM.
        - REALLY SIMPLE.

SO I THINK IF HE CAN GO TO WORK
     IN JUST A WHITE T-SHIRT,
       I THINK HE WOULD.
          - HE WOULD.
           - MM-HMM.
      - ALL RIGHT. DOREEN.

  - I'M GONNA SAY HIS BOXERS.
         - HIS BOXERS.
      - BECAUSE AS SOON AS
    HE COMES HOME FROM WORK,
           THAT'S IT.
   EVERYTHING'S OFF--BOXERS.

       - JUST THE BOXERS.
         - THAT'S IT.
    - NEXT QUESTION, LADIES.
       WHERE ON YOUR BODY
IS YOUR HUSBAND'S FAVORITE SPOT

        FOR THOSE LITTLE
JUST-BECAUSE-I-LOVE-YOU KISSES?
             ERICA.
   - I DON'T GET THOSE OFTEN,
             BUT, UM,

   WHEN I DO GET JUST LITTLE
      JUST-BECAUSE KISSES,
     IT'S PROBABLY JUST...
         REALLY LIGHTLY
       RIGHT ON THE LIPS.

        - OKAY. DOREEN.
       - REALLY LIGHTLY.
    - I'M GONNA SAY MY NECK.
          - YOUR NECK.
            - YEAH.
      - ALL RIGHT. SARAH.

     - I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO
         WITH MY BUTT.
          - YOUR BUTT!
        ALL RIGHT, GIRL!
            [laughs]
           ALL RIGHT.

           [applause]
        SO WE KNOW WHAT
   HIS FAVORITE SPOT IS, HUH.
            - YES.
            - OKAY.

         LADIES, HERE'S
      OUR BONUS QUESTION.
       IT HAS TWO PARTS.
 EACH PART IS WORTH 15 POINTS.
          HERE WE GO.

    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.
IF MY HUSBAND WAS FORCED TO GET
   A PERSONALITY TRANSPLANT,
    I WOULD WANT THE DONOR
    TO BE HIS FRIEND BLANK,

    BECAUSE IF IT WOUND UP
    BEING HIS FRIEND BLANK,
     I WOULD NOT BE HAPPY.
            DOREEN.

        HIS FRIEND ROB.
          - ALL RIGHT.
     - BECAUSE HE'S JUST--
        HE'S EASYGOING.

   - AND HIS FRIEND SHAWNIE,
 WHO IS THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE.
   - ROB AND SHAWNIE. SARAH.

       - OKAY, SO IT'D BE
        HIS FRIEND BUNK.
     UM, AND IF IT WOUND UP
   BEING HIS FRIEND MICHAEL,
     I WOULD NOT BE HAPPY.

       - OKAY, WHAT IS IT
         ABOUT MICHAEL?
         - HE'S JUST--
      JUST A LITTLE CRAZY.
         - OKAY. ERICA.

      - UH, THE FIRST ONE
         WOULD BE JOHN.
   UM, AND FOR THE LAST ONE,
     HE DOESN'T REALLY HAVE
 ANY FRIENDS THAT I DON'T LIKE.

           - MM-HMM.
     - SO, UH, I WOULD SAY
         THAT--NO ONE.
           - NO ONE.

       THE GUYS ARE BACK
    TO SEE IF THEY CAN MATCH
 THE ANSWERS THEIR WIVES GAVE.

     BUT BEFORE WE DO THAT,
   LET US CHECK ON THE SCORE.
       ALMASI AND SARAH,
    YOU GUYS ARE IN THE LEAD
        WITH 15 POINTS.

        MARC AND DOREEN,
        DAVE AND ERICA,
   YOU DON'T HAVE ANY POINTS,
     BUT WE'RE ONLY HALFWAY
       THROUGH THIS GAME.

 ALL RIGHT. SO HERE'S THE FIRST
   OF OUR 10-POINT QUESTIONS.
   GENTLEMEN, IF I ASKED YOU
     ABOUT YOUR VERY FIRST
       SEXUAL EXPERIENCE,

   DID YOUR WIFE SAY YOU'D BE
   MOST EMBARRASSED TO TELL ME
   WHO, WHAT, WHERE, OR WHEN?
             MARC.

  - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY WHERE.
            - WHERE.
   - WE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE...
       - NO, GET INTO IT.
   - A GOOD LIVING SITUATION
          AT THE TIME,

   SO THERE WAS SOMEBODY ELSE
         VERY CLOSE-BY
 THAT'S SORT OF RELATED TO ME.
            - OKAY.
       - SO IT WAS IN A--

      LISTEN, WE GOTTA DO
       WHAT WE GOTTA DO.
         - WHAT? OKAY.
            - IT WAS
    A VERY SMALL APARTMENT.

      I'M GONNA SAY THAT.
          - ALL RIGHT.
           - WE DID.
   - DOREEN, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

       DOREEN SAID WHEN.
       - BUT WHERE WAS IT?
     - I DON'T KNOW, BUT...
      - MY FIRST WITH HER,
         OR FIRST EVER?

      - IT WAS YOUR FIRST
      SEXUAL EXPERIENCE.
           - MY BAD.
       - YEAH, YOUR BAD.
      - ALL RIGHT, ALMASI,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?

         - WHOO. WHERE.
          - ALL RIGHT.
     - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
 KIND OF LIKE THEIR SITUATION.
           [laughter]

 I NEEDED TO TAKE CARE OF THAT
        AT A, YOU KNOW,
        MOMENT'S NOTICE.
       DIDN'T REALLY HAVE
    A WHOLE LOT OF OPTIONS.

       - AND WHERE MIGHT
        THAT HAVE BEEN?
       - NOT AT MY HOUSE,
           BY THE WAY.
           [laughter]

  - YOU DIDN'T SEE HIM THERE.
        WHERE WOULD THAT
           HAVE BEEN?
    - LET'S JUST SAY IT WAS
 SOMEWHERE ON THE JERSEY SHORE.

             - AH!
        - THERE YOU GO.
       - YOU HAD YOUR OWN
      <i>JERSEY SHORE</i> GOING ON.
             - HEY.
          - ALL RIGHT.

     SARAH, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
             WHERE!
             - YES!
       [cheers, applause]

            - OH...
          OKAY, DAVE,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
     - I'M GONNA BE TRENDY
       AND SAY WHERE TOO.

         OURS WAS IN A,
     UH, CHEAP HOTEL ROOM.
             - AH!
            ALL RIGHT.
     ERICA, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

             WHEN.
           - NOT OURS.
        YOUR FIRST EVER.
        - OH. ALL RIGHT.
        OH, WELL. SORRY.

        - THE FIRST EV--
         SEE, I DON'T--
          MEN, LIST--
       THEY DON'T--YEAH.
- THEY HEARD "SEXUAL ENCOUNTER,"
 AND IT'S ALL DARK AFTER THAT.

           [laughter]
          - ALL RIGHT,
       THE NEXT QUESTION
            IS FROM
    OUR FASHIONABLE FRIENDS

           AT MACY'S.
       HOW DID YOUR WIFE
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
   IF MY HUSBAND HAD HIS WAY,

   HE'D WEAR HIS BLANK 24/7.
            ALMASI.
     - MAYBE MY FLIP-FLOPS
           AND SOCKS?

      - FLIP-FLOPS AND S--
        THAT'S A VISUAL!
           [laughter]
 THAT IS JUST THE HOTTEST COMBO
   I EVER PICTURED IN MY MIND.

     - I'M COUNTRY, SHERRI.
     - YOU WEAR YOUR SOCKS
     WITH YOUR FLIP-FLOPS?
         - I'M COUNTRY.
           - HE DOES.

            - YEAH.
    - AND IT'S COMFORTABLE.
            - OKAY.
  - SO THAT'S HOW I GET DOWN.
     - ALL RIGHT, SO IT IS
 THE FLIP-FLOPS AND THE SOCKS.

     SARAH, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
         FOOTBALL GEAR.
       - OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
          - ALL RIGHT.
 - DON'T KNOW ABOUT EVERYWHERE.
         - OH, BABE...

    - THAT'S A LITTLE, UH...
     OKAY. GIVE IT A SHOT.
            - DAVE.

     - OOH, THIS IS TOUGH,
         THIS IS TOUGH.
        BUT I'M GONNA GO
           WITH, UH...
     MY SUPERHERO T-SHIRT.

            SHE L--
   SHE DOESN'T EVEN HATE IT.
        SHE LOATHES IT.
    EVERY TIME I WALK OUT...
         "TAKE IT OFF!

       JUST TAKE IT OFF!"
     I REALLY, REALLY HOPE
           I'M RIGHT,
            OR ELSE
      I'M GETTING SMACKED.

    - WHAT SUPERHERO IS IT?
    - SPECIFICALLY SUPERMAN.
        - IT'S SUPERMAN.
          - SUPERMAN.
          NICE BIG "S"
      RIGHT ON THE CHEST.

     - RIGHT ON THE CHEST.
      THE SUPERHERO SHIRT.
           ALL RIGHT.
       THE WHITE T-SHIRT.

        - OH, ALL RIGHT.
    - JUST A WHITE T-SHIRT.
       I HATE THAT SHIRT.
  I THOUGHT WE THREW IT AWAY.

    - THAT'S WHY I SAID IT!
     THAT'S WHY I SAID IT.
       - I WOULDN'T--NO.
        - YOU'RE FIRED.
      YOU'RE STILL FIRED.

    - YOU THOUGHT IT WAS GONE?
              - NO.
     - YOU THOUGHT HE THREW
   THE SUPERHERO T-SHIRT AWAY?
      - I THINK I THREW
  THE SUPERHERO SHIRT AWAY.

       - I STILL HAVE IT.
- SO HE GOT IT OUT THE GARBAGE.
  - HE MIGHT'VE. IN THE MOVE.
         - I THINK SO.
        ALL RIGHT, MARC,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?

  - I WOULD HAVE TO GO WITH--
I MEAN, THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS
    I CAN PROBABLY GO WITH,
   BUT I'D SAY MY SWEATPANTS.

    - YOUR SWEATPANTS 24/7.
    DOREEN, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
  - YOUR BOXERS. YOU ALWAYS--
- I'M GONNA WEAR 'EM, OF COURSE!
      - BUT YOU COME HOME,
   YOU TAKE YOUR CLOTHES OFF,

      AND JUST YOUR BOXERS
          EVERY NIGHT.
   - SHE HATES MY SWEATPANTS.
   - YEAH, BUT I DIDN'T SAY--
       SHE DIDN'T ASK ME
         IF I HATE 'EM.

           IT'S JUST
       SOMETHING YOU DO.
 - WHAT DO I WEAR ALL THE TIME?
           - BOXERS.
       - AND SWEATPANTS.

        GET OUT OF HERE.
           [laughter]
   THAT WAS MY SECOND CHOICE,
          BY THE WAY.

  - THAT WAS YOUR SECOND ONE.
        OKAY, GENTLEMEN,
         NEXT QUESTION.
    ACCORDING TO YOUR WIFE,

       WHERE ON HER BODY
     IS YOUR FAVORITE SPOT
        FOR THOSE LITTLE
JUST-BECAUSE-I-LOVE-YOU KISSES?
             DAVE.

   - JUST-BECAUSE-I-LOVE-YOU
           KISSES...
    I'LL GO WITH THE OBVIOUS
         AND SAY LIPS.
  - HER LIPS. WHAT'D YOU SAY?
        - OH, THANK YOU!

          - YES, LIPS.
    - THANK GOD. OH, MY GOD.
         THANK GOD. OH!
           - FINALLY!

     - YOU SAVED YOURSELF.
  THAT'S ONLY A SMALL AMOUNT,
         BUT IT'LL DO.
           - [laughs]
     MARC, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

    - ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GONNA
  HAVE TO GET ONE RIGHT HERE.
            - OKAY.
     - I WOULD PROBABLY SAY
            MY NECK.

   - YOUR NECK, OR HER NECK?
       - NECK. THAT'S ALL
          I'M SAYING.
   - NECK. ALL YOU'RE SAYING.

       ALL RIGHT, DOREEN,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
          both: NECK.
             - YAY!
      WE'RE NOT GONNA GET
        SHUT OUT, BABY.

            [laughs]
 - YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN HIS FACE.
    HE WAS LIKE, "OH, GOD!"
     - "PLEASE BE 'NECK.'"

          WHOSE NECK,
      I DON'T KNOW, BUT...
   - ALMASI, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
       - YEAH, THIS ONE'S
          PRETTY EASY.

         - THAT'S YOUR
      FAVORITE PLACE, HUH.

      - I'M ALWAYS THERE.
       I'M ALWAYS THERE.
    WHENEVER I CAN BE THERE,
  THAT'S THE PLACE I WANNA BE.
- IN YOUR SOCKS AND FLIP-FLOPS.
        - THAT'S RIGHT.

    - SARAH, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
             MY BUTT!
           - MM-HMM.
     - GOT THAT ONE RIGHT.
          - I KNEW IT.

     A THANKSGIVING TURKEY,
    OR A 1978 CHEVY IMPALA?
              BEN?

       I'M GONNA GO WITH
        THE, UH, IMPALA.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    WHAT ABOUT YOU, DENNIS?

   - I WOULD SAY I WOULD PARK
           THE TURKEY
WITH MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF SIDES
   OF CRANBERRY OR SOMETHING.
      - SOME GARNISHMENTS
          ON THE SIDE.

     - YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
       - ALL RIGHT, ROB?
  - SHERRI, I GOTTA TELL YOU,
      SHE'S NOT GONNA LIKE
      ANYTHING BACK THERE,
    BUT I'D PUT THE TURKEY.

         - THE TURKEY.
         - ABSOLUTELY.
       - OKAY, HUSBANDS,
  THIS IS YOUR NEXT QUESTION.
  GUYS, THINK BACK AND TELL US
     EXACTLY WHAT YOUR WIFE

      WAS WEARING THE DAY
  YOU PROPOSED TO HER. DENNIS?
   - I BETTER REMEMBER THIS,
         BECAUSE IT WAS
       HER 30th BIRTHDAY.
            - OKAY.

       - SHE WAS WEARING
     A SHORT PURPLE DRESS.
          - OKAY. ROB?
    - I ALSO REMEMBER THIS.

  UH, IT'S A PURPLE DRESS WITH
  A FEW RHINESTONES UP ON TOP.
   SHE HAD JUST FINISHED HER
BALLET RECITAL FOR ALL THE KIDS,
     AND I CAME UP ONSTAGE

 IN FRONT OF A THOUSAND PEOPLE
         AND PROPOSED.
   - AND YOU PROPOSED TO HER
   IN FRONT OF ALL THE KIDS.
    - YES, I DID. YES, I DID.
             - AW.

     WAS SHE SO SURPRISED.
 - OH, MAN, IT WAS GREAT, YEAH.
    - OH, MY GOODNESS. BEN?
      - WOW, I CAN BARELY
      REMEMBER YESTERDAY.

             UM...
            - UH-OH.
       - SHE WAS WEARING
      BLACK TIGHTS AND...

        A YELLOW SHIRT.
     - AND A YELLOW SHIRT.
             - NO,
  WE'LL GO WITH PURPLE SHIRT.

       - A PURPLE SHIRT.
     - YEAH, PURPLE SHIRT.
    - NO SKIRT, NO NOTHIN',
       BLACK TIGHTS AND--
           - NO, NO.
            - OKAY.

   HERE'S OUR NEXT QUESTION,
           HUSBANDS.
   IF THEY RETITLED THE BOOK,
             <i>THE GIRL</i>
     <i>WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO,</i>

 BASED ON THE ANIMAL YOUR WIFE
     MOST RESEMBLES IN BED,
       IT WOULD BE CALLED
             <i>THE GIRL</i>
    <i>WITH THE BLANK TATTOO.</i> ROB?

   - UH, DEFINITELY A BUNNY.
    WE'RE--WE'RE VERY QUICK,
    AND WE GET RIGHT TO IT.
  AND, YOU KNOW, WE KNOW WHAT
   WE HAVE TO DO, ABSOLUTELY.

         A LITTLE, UH,
      WHITE, FUZZY BUNNY.
          ABSOLUTELY.
       - VERY QUICK, HUH?
             - HEY.
             - BEN?

      - I WANT BUNNY ALSO.
     - YOU LIKE BUNNY, TOO?
            - YEAH.
- OKAY, DENNIS, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
          - A POODLE.

          - A POODLE?
   - BECAUSE--SHE KNOWS THIS.
     BUT A POODLE IS REALLY
         A HUNTING DOG.
  IT'S REALLY VICIOUS IF YOU
 GET TO KNOW THEM, SO A POODLE.

    - OKAY, SO YOU'RE SAYING
    SHE'S VICIOUS IN THERE.
             OKAY.
 - A LITTLE BIT, A LITTLE BIT.
      - ALL RIGHT, FELLAS,
      THANK YOU. NICE JOB.

       I HOPE YOUR WIVES

           ALL RIGHT,
      THE WIVES ARE BACK,
          AND, LADIES,
      WHILE YOU WERE GONE,
     I ASKED YOUR HUSBANDS
        THREE QUESTIONS,

     AND NOW IT'S YOUR JOB
TO TRY AND MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.
      EACH CORRECT ANSWER
       IS WORTH 5 POINTS,
         SO HERE WE GO.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,

  WHICH OF THE FOLLOWING ITEMS
      DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY
  HE COULD PARK IN THE SHADOW
       OF YOUR REAR END--
           AN APPLE,

     A THANKSGIVING TURKEY,
    OR A 1978 CHEVY IMPALA?
             TANIA?

        - I'M GONNA SAY
      THANKSGIVING TURKEY,
BECAUSE IT'S NOT TOO BIG, BUT...
 - HE SAID A '78 CHEVY IMPALA.

         - OH, COME ON.
          - ALL RIGHT.
             JODI?
        - I'LL GO SAFE.
        I'LL SAY TURKEY,

    BECAUSE, YEAH, TURKEY'S
     A NICE, ROUND FIGURE.
          - I LOVE IT.
   DENNIS, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
     A THANKSGIVING TURKEY.

  - WITH A SIDE OF CRANBERRY.
         - WITH A SIDE
     OF CRANBERRIES, JODI.
    - AIMEE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

 - UM, I WOULD DEFINITELY HAVE
TO SAY THAT HE WOULD SAY APPLE,
          BECAUSE, UM,
    I-I THINK HE WISHED THAT
     IT WOULD BE MORE LIKE

    THE THANKSGIVING TURKEY,
 BUT IT'S NOT QUITE THERE YET.
            - OKAY.
     ROB, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
      - I SAID THE TURKEY.
    IT'S GOT BIG DRUMSTICKS.

           YOU KNOW?
         - ALL RIGHT--
     - ITS LEGS! BIG LEGS!
        - I-I AM TOTALLY
       FEELING YOU, ROB,

     BUT YOUR WIFE DOES NOT
       LOOK HAPPY AT ALL.
             - NO.
      - AN APPLE'S SMALL.
           - THANKS.

              WOW.
          - ALL RIGHT.
        WELL, MOVIN' ON.
     LADIES, NEXT QUESTION.

 WE ASKED YOUR HUSBAND TO THINK
    BACK AND TELL US EXACTLY
     WHAT YOU WERE WEARING
  THE DAY HE PROPOSED TO YOU.
   WHAT DO YOU THINK HE SAID?

             JODI?
     - HE BETTER REMEMBER.
   I WAS WEARING A PINK DRESS
       WITH A GOLD BELT.
        - OKAY, DENNIS,

  WAS SHE WEARING A PINK DRESS
       WITH A GOLD BELT?
    - A SHORT PURPLE DRESS.
  - YOU WORE PURPLE. YOU SAID
  THAT'S YOUR FAVORITE COLOR.

 - YOU KNOW YOU'RE COLOR-BLIND,
            THOUGH.
      - I MEAN, THIS IS--
        THIS IS PURPLE.
      - IT WAS THAT COLOR.
       - NO, IT WAS NOT.

    - CAN'T WIN. CAN'T WIN.
- IS SHE WEARING PINK OR PURPLE?
    - THAT'S PINK, I THINK.
    - THAT'S THE SAME--OKAY.
    - THAT'S THE SAME COLOR.

   - DON'T GET IN ANY TROUBLE
        WITH ME, DENNIS.
   - I'M TRYIN'. I'M TRYIN'.
 - GO ON, SHERRI, JUST MOVE ON.
            MOVE ON.
    - AIMEE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

   - OKAY, THIS IS DEFINITE--
      HE BETTER REMEMBER,
       BECAUSE WE HAVE IT
         ON VIDEOTAPE,
  AND WE'VE WATCHED IT LOOPED
 MANY, MANY, MANY, MANY TIMES.

  IT WAS A LIGHT PURPLE DRESS.
          - ALL RIGHT,
     WHAT DID YOU SAY, ROB?
        - PURPLE DRESS.
       - A PURPLE DRESS.

              YES.
        YES. ALL RIGHT,
  AND, TANIA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
 - UH, I'M GONNA SAY A PINK TOP
         AND A BLACK--

          BLACK PANTS
       AND A HEAVY COAT,
    'CAUSE HE, UH, PROPOSED
 IN THE MIDDLE OF CENTRAL PARK
       AT 10:30 AT NIGHT.
        - OH, ALL RIGHT.

  OKAY, WHAT DID YOU SAY, BEN?
          BLACK TIGHTS
      AND A PURPLE SHIRT.
     - WHAT'S WITH YOU GUYS
        AND THE COLORS?

            - OKAY.

   THE BOOK WOULD BE CALLED,
             <i>THE GIRL</i>
   <i>WITH THE BLANK TATTOO.</i> AIMEE?
       - THE CAT TATTOO?

   - ARE YOU--OKAY, I SEE YOU
 KINDA--ARE YOU CATLIKE IN BED?
    - I-I CAN'T REALLY THINK
      OF AN ANIMAL THAT--
          I'M NOT VERY
      ANIMALISTIC IN BED,

          TO TELL YOU
    THE GOD'S HONEST TRUTH.
  I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THE CAT.
 - OKAY, ROB, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

     WHEN YOU GET INTO BED?
      - JUST A LITTLE BIT.
     - BEN, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

         - WELCOME BACK

 ALL RIGHT, LADIES, IT IS YOUR
TURN TO ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS.

   THESE NEXT THREE ARE WORTH
        10 POINTS EACH.
          HERE WE GO.
   WITH THE AMOUNT OF NAILING

    YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND DO,
        COULD YOU BUILD
    A BIRDHOUSE, A DOGHOUSE,

        OR A GUESTHOUSE?
             TANIA?
 - I'M GONNA SAY A GUESTHOUSE.
        - A GUESTHOUSE.
 - 'CAUSE WE'RE NEWLY MARRIED.
            - OKAY.

            [growls]
            - JODI?
   - I'M GONNA KEEP IT REAL,
            SHERRI.

       IT'S A BIRDHOUSE.
         - A BIRDHOUSE?
       - BECAUSE--I KNOW.

    SEE, WHAT HAPPENED WAS,
        WE'RE JUST SO--
        - WHAT HAPPENED?
      - WE'RE ALWAYS BUSY.
    LIKE, HE WORKS MORNINGS.
       I WORK EVENINGS...

            - OKAY.
          - SO IT'S--
 THE COORDINATION JUST NEVER--
     - BUT YOU'RE THE GIRL
    WITH THE POODLE TATTOO!

       - WE FALL ASLEEP.
      IT'S BAD. IT'S BAD.
         - OKAY. AIMEE?
      - UM, I'M GONNA SAY
         THE DOGHOUSE.

          - DOGHOUSE.
     - WE'RE KIND OF BUSY,
 SO WE KEEP IT TO THE DOGHOUSE.
     - PUTS YOU RIGHT THERE
         IN THE MIDDLE.

  - RIGHT THERE IN THE MIDDLE
       IS EXACTLY RIGHT.
    - WIVES, NEXT QUESTION.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE--
       IF MY HUSBAND WERE
   AN ECCENTRIC BILLIONAIRE,

      I BET HE'D BE KNOWN
       FOR HIS IMPRESSIVE
       BLANK COLLECTION.
             JODI?

       - SHOE COLLECTION.
   SHERRI, THIS MAN HAS AN--
         OVER 200 PAIRS
          OF SNEAKERS.

        - WHAT? REALLY?
      - MORE THAN ME, YES.
- HE IS INTO HIS SNEAKERS, HUH?

         - YES, SHOES.
      - ALL RIGHT, AIMEE?
    - HE DOESN'T REALLY HAVE
A LOT OF ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR.

            UM, WE--
 WE CLEANED OUT A LOT OF STUFF
         WHEN WE MOVED
 INTO OUR--OUR PLACE TOGETHER.
         - YOUR PLACE.

           - MEANING,
   HE GOT RID OF EVERYTHING,
       AND I GOT TO KEEP
      EVERYTHING OF MINE.
             - OH.
    - UM, SO I-I THINK MAYBE

 THE THING THAT HE HAS THE MOST
     OF WOULD BE HIS TOOLS.
          - HIS TOOLS.
      - YEAH, THAT'S OKAY.
         - OKAY. TANIA?

         - I WOULD SAY
     UNDERWEAR COLLECTION.
  - HIS UNDERWEAR COLLECTION?
  - 'CAUSE EVERY TIME I WASH,
       IT DOESN'T MATTER.

 HIS DRAWER'S STILL OVERFLOWING
     WITH DIFFERENT COLORS.
       I DON'T EVEN KNOW
    WHAT HE DOES WITH THEM.
       - WELL, HOPEFULLY
       HE'S WEARING 'EM.

   - I MEAN, SOMETIMES, YEAH.
           - GOT YOU.
      NOW A QUESTION FROM
 ASHLEY FURNITURE HOME STORE--
       FURNITURE YOU BOTH
         CAN AGREE ON.

WHERE IN YOUR HOUSE WOULD I FIND
        THE MOST CRUMBS
       AND BITS OF FOOD--
    UNDER THE KITCHEN TABLE,
    IN BETWEEN THE CUSHIONS
         ON THE COUCH,

        OR IN THE SHEETS
      OF YOUR BED? AIMEE?
         - OH, THIS ONE
      IS VERY, VERY EASY.
 WE WOULD FIND THEM IN BETWEEN
   THE CUSHIONS OF THE COUCH,

      'CAUSE THAT'S WHERE
    WE DO ALL OF OUR EATING
    WHILE WE'RE WATCHING TV,
 AND HE IS A VERY SLOPPY EATER,
   SO AFTER EVERY MEAL, THEN
  I HAVE TO CLEAR IT ALL AWAY.

     - SO IT'S RIGHT THERE
       IN THOSE CUSHIONS.
  - OH, YES, ABSOLUTELY, EASY.
 - OKAY. WHAT ABOUT YOU, TANIA?
        - I'M GONNA SAY
     IN BETWEEN THE SHEETS.

    - IN BETWEEN THE SHEETS?
     - 'CAUSE I LIKE TO...
         - EAT IN BED?
         - EAT IN BED.
      - YEAH, OKAY. JODI?
    - CUSHIONS OF THE COUCH,

        'CAUSE, I MEAN,
   HE'S ALLOWED TO KEEP THOSE
  SO HE CAN FIX THINGS FOR US.
  I'M A--I'M THE SLOPPY EATER,

       AND THEN THEY ALL
      LAND ON THE SHELF...
           - UH-HUH.
    - AND THEN YOU GOTTA...
       - I KNOW. I KNOW.

I KNOW, I STILL GOT SOME KETCHUP
     I CAN'T FIND ON HERE.
   I'M STILL LOOKIN' FOR IT.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
    HERE'S A BONUS QUESTION.

        IT HAS 2 PARTS.
 EACH PART IS WORTH 15 POINTS.
          HERE WE GO.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE--
   IF I COULD GIVE MY HUSBAND
    TWO TIPS IN THE BEDROOM,

    IT WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT
         MORE OF BLANK,
     AND A LITTLE BIT LESS
        OF BLANK. TANIA?
   - A LITTLE MORE CARESSING

   AND A LITTLE LESS BITING.
    - WELL, YOU'RE THE LION.
  WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- HE'S A LITTLE WORSE THAN I AM.
         - OKAY. JODI?

     - I'D SAY A LITTLE BIT
         MORE FOREPLAY.
            - OKAY.
   - A LITTLE LESS SLEEPIN'.

       - I'M TELLIN' YA,
      I'M KEEPIN' IT REAL.
  - AND WHAT ABOUT YOU, AIMEE?

       - UM, I WOULD SAY
   A LITTLE BIT MORE ROMANCE
     AND A LITTLE BIT LESS

  OF JUST GETTIN' IT ON DONE.
  - IS HE NOT ROMANTIC ENOUGH?
     - UM, HE REALLY WANTS
        TO BE ROMANTIC,

    UM, BUT OFTEN, HE JUST--
         HE JUST REALLY
     WANTS TO GET IT, YEAH.
           - [laughs]

     BUT BEFORE WE DO THAT,
   LET'S CHECK ON THE SCORE.
  COUPLE NUMBER TWO, YOU GUYS
ARE IN THE LEAD WITH 10 POINTS.

        ALL RIGHT, YEAH.
        HERE'S THE FIRST
   OF OUR 10-POINT QUESTIONS.
           GENTLEMEN,
   WITH THE AMOUNT OF NAILING

     YOU AND YOUR WIFE DO,
     DID SHE SAY YOU COULD
       BUILD A BIRDHOUSE,
          A DOGHOUSE,
        OR A GUESTHOUSE?

              BEN?
- I'M GONNA GO WITH A DOGHOUSE,
           BECAUSE...
  WE CAN'T BUILD A GUESTHOUSE,
          BUT WE'RE--

        WE'RE UP THERE.
    - YOU'RE UP THERE, HUH?
             TANIA?
         - GUESTHOUSE.
        - A GUESTHOUSE.

            - WHAT?
  - I THINK YOU'LL BE SLEEPING
        IN THE DOGHOUSE.
  - THAT'S RIGHT, YOU WILL BE.

   - DENNIS, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
 - I WOULD SAY A DOGHOUSE, TOO,
    BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, NOT--
          YOU'D NAIL--

  NAIL MORE THAN A BIRDHOUSE,
       SOMETHING BIGGER.
        BUT A GUESTHOUSE
   IS A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH.
   - OKAY, WHAT DID YOU SAY,
             JODI?

          A BIRDHOUSE.
         - OOH, REALLY?
            - SORRY.
           - REALLY?

       I HAVE WORK TO DO.
       - YEAH, YOU BETTER
     GET TO NAILIN', YEAH.
   - I HAVE SOME WORK TO DO.
        OKAY, I GOT YOU.

       - ALL RIGHT, ROB?
 - SHERRI, IF IT WAS UP TO ME,
     IT'D BE A GUESTHOUSE.
            - OKAY.

        - IT'S GONNA BE
      A DOGHOUSE, THOUGH.
   - AIMEE, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
        A DOGHOUSE, YES.

      YOU SAID IF IT WERE
           UP TO YOU,
   IT WOULD BE A GUESTHOUSE?
            - YEAH.
     - SO IS THAT THE GOAL
         YOU ASPIRE TO?

      - I'M WORKING ON IT
       EVERY TIME I CAN.
     - I'M WORKING TOWARDS
         THE BIRDHOUSE.
     - HUSBANDS, HERE WE GO
    WITH THE NEXT QUESTION.

       HOW DID YOUR WIFE
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
       IF MY HUSBAND WERE
   AN ECCENTRIC BILLIONAIRE,
      I BET HE'D BE KNOWN

       FOR HIS IMPRESSIVE
       BLANK COLLECTION.
            DENNIS?
    - IT WOULD BE SNEAKERS,
        SHOE COLLECTION,

   EASILY, BECAUSE I AM JUST
  A FANATIC WITH THOSE THINGS.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    JODI, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
        SHOE COLLECTION.

            - EASY.
             - ROB?
     - IT'S GONNA BE CARS,
       NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

       I HAD A SPORTS CAR
 FOR A FEW YEARS. I LOVE CARS.
IT WOULD ABSOLUTELY BE A GARAGE,
         LIKE JAY LENO,
 IT'D BE A GARAGE FULL OF CARS.

         - OKAY, AIMEE,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
       - TOOL COLLECTION.
            - AIMEE.
   - I KNOW THAT'S WHAT YOU--
   - AIMEE, MY WHOLE THING--

     - I KNOW YOU WISH THAT
  YOU HAD A LOT OF CARS, BUT--
     - BUT THE QUESTION WAS
    IF I WAS A BILLIONAIRE.
        - YEAH, BUT I--

 - THAT WOULD BE THE ONLY THING
      I'D SPEND MONEY ON.
      - I THOUGHT IT MEANT
  WHAT YOU HAVE A LOT OF NOW.
           - [sighs]

      - THAT WOULD BE SUCH
      AN EASY QUESTION...
          - OH, GOSH.
     "TO THE MOON, ALICE."
        I JUST LOVE IT.

           OKAY, BEN,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
   - THE ONLY THING I REALLY
       COLLECT RIGHT NOW
   WOULD BE MY BASEBALL CARDS
       AND SPORTS CARDS,

           BUT, YEAH,
      I'LL GO WITH THAT--
         BASEBALL CARDS
       AND SPORTS CARDS.
         - OKAY, TANIA,
  WHAT DID YOU SAY? UNDERWEAR.

          - UNDERWEAR?
       - 'CAUSE YOU HAVE
        SO MANY OF THEM.
  - WHY WOULD I GET MORE THEN?
     I ALREADY HAVE ENOUGH.

      - 'CAUSE YOU'D WANT
    NEW PAIRS, I DON'T KNOW.
       - SHE SAYS YOU GOT
        A LOT OF COLORS,
   AND THEY'RE JUST SPILLING
       OUT OF THE DRAWER.

          - UNDERWEAR?
    - ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN,
    OUR NEXT QUESTION, FROM
  ASHLEY FURNITURE HOME STORE.
      WHERE IN YOUR HOUSE
       DID YOUR WIFE SAY

    I'D FIND THE MOST CRUMBS
       AND BITS OF FOOD--
    UNDER THE KITCHEN TABLE,
    IN BETWEEN THE CUSHIONS
         ON THE COUCH,

        OR IN THE SHEETS
       OF YOUR BED? ROB?
   - IT'S GONNA BE THE COUCH.
    WE EAT LUNCH, BREAKFAST,
           AND DINNER

  IN THE COUCH, ALL THE TIME--
      SNACKS, EVERYTHING.

    'EM UP AFTER ME. COUCH.
          - ALL RIGHT,

         IN THE COUCH.
         YOU ARE HAPPY!
            - YEAH!
          - OKAY, BEN.

  - I ALWAYS COMPLAIN TO HER,
   SHE HAS CRUMBS IN THE BED.
      - ALL RIGHT, TANIA,

   IN THE SHEETS OF OUR BED.

           ALL RIGHT.
            DENNIS?
     - EASILY IN THE COUCH.

        WE DO EVERYTHING
         IN THE COUCH.
          - THAT'S WHY
       IT'S THE BIRDCAGE.
   COME BACK TO THE BEDROOM,

         EAT GOOD FATS.

 CARBS ARE BAD. CARBS ARE GOOD.

   THE STORY KEEPS CHANGING.
    SO I'M NOT LISTENING...
     TO ANYONE BUT MYSELF.

    I KNOW BETTER NUTRITION

     NUTRITION YOU CAN SEE.

         GREAT GRAINS.
     SEARCH GREAT GRAINS
     AND SEE FOR YOURSELF.
 FOR MULTI GRAIN FLAKES THAT ARE
 AN EXCELLENT SOURCE OF FIBER

 IT'S OKAY, BECAUSE IT IS TIME
    FOR OUR FINAL QUESTION.

 THIS IS WORTH UP TO 30 POINTS.
    IT CAN CHANGE EVERYTHING
    FOR ANYBODY. HERE WE GO.
  GENTLEMEN, HOW DID YOUR WIFE
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE--

   IF I COULD GIVE MY HUSBAND
    TWO TIPS IN THE BEDROOM,
          IT WOULD BE
  A LITTLE BIT MORE OF BLANK,

     AND A LITTLE BIT LESS
           OF BLANK.
              BEN?
         - I WOULD SAY
   A LITTLE BIT MORE KISSING

   AND A LITTLE LESS BITING,
  BECAUSE SHE ALWAYS COMPLAINS
        I'M BITING HER.
          - ALL RIGHT.
             TANIA?

 - A LITTLE BIT MORE CARESSING,
     A LITTLE LESS BITING.
    - GOT THE BITING RIGHT.

          YOUR ANSWER?

     - A LITTLE BIT MORE--
   - I SAID A LITTLE BIT MORE
         OF THE ROMANCE
     AND A LITTLE BIT LESS
     OF THE JUST GETTING IT
           GOIN' ON.

- OKAY, THE ROMANCE IS CORRECT.
       WE CAN TAKE THAT.
      YOU GOT HALF RIGHT.

   - ALL RIGHT, SO RIGHT NOW
  YOU ARE IN THE LEAD. DENNIS?
      - A LITTLE BIT MORE
   OF THE FOREPLAY, I GUESS,

 THE HUGGING, LOVING, TOUCHING,
      THAT TYPE OF STUFF,
     AND A LITTLE BIT LESS
  OF THE RUSH, I GUESS, NOT--
    DON'T GO SO FAST, SO...

            - OKAY.

     FELLAS, NEXT QUESTION.

         I CAN THINK OF
      IS MAYBE SHE THOUGHT
         I WAS FLIRTING
    WITH SOME GIRL AT A BAR,
      AND I WASN'T, SO...

        - BUT WERE YOU?
        - OF COURSE NOT.
     - I WAS JUST PLAYING.

      ALL RIGHT, SHANNON.

   - I BELIEVE IT WOULD HAVE
       TO BE SIMILAR TO--
    TO HIS ANSWER, YOU KNOW.
 MAYBE MORE DISCREET FLIRTING.

   - WHAT IS DISCREET FLIRTING?
           [laughter]

  BUT I COULDN'T TELL YOU, UH,
 ARTISTS' NAMES IS THE PROBLEM.
             SO...

      HE'S GOT LONG HAIR,
     LOTS OF TATTOOS, UH...

      OR AN ENTIRE GARAGE?
            CIEMONE.

      - A TRUNK IN A CAR--
        THE SECOND ONE--
     'CAUSE HE ALWAYS SAYS
     "JUNK IN THE TRUNK."
            - OKAY.
            - SO...

 HE ALWAYS SAYS THAT ABOUT ME,
    SO I'M HOPING THAT'S IT.

  OUR FIRST FIGHT ABOUT BLANK,
      I KNEW THE HONEYMOON
      WAS DEFINITELY OVER.

             NANCY.
   - I GUESS ABOUT SCHEDULES.
        I'M ALWAYS LATE,

      AND HE ALWAYS TRIES
         TO BE ON TIME.
     - JOE, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

             - MM.
            - FINE.
           [laughter]

            - KELLY.
      - IT'S GOTTA BE HIM
     CLEANING UP THE DISHES
 OR CLEANING UP AFTER HIMSELF.

           HE NEVER--
  I DON'T EVEN THINK HE KNOWS
    WHERE THE DISHWASHER IS.
             - OH!

    JAMES, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
    HIM FLIRTING IN THE BAR.
        - YOU DID THAT?

    [audience oohs, laughs]
        - GUESS IT WASN'T
   A VERY BIG FIGHT, WAS IT?

           - [laughs]

     - HE WAS KIND OF MEAN
           AT FIRST,
     'CAUSE HE WOULD ALWAYS
         MAKE FUN OF ME.
   BUT IT WAS JUST HIM TRYING
TO GET ATTENTION FROM ME, SO...

     A "NEEDS IMPROVEMENT"

    WHEN IT COMES TO BLANK.
            CIEMONE.
        - I'M GONNA SAY
          MAYBE AN "A"

         WHEN IT COMES
      TO RUBBING MY FEET.

  AND GETTING THINGS STARTED.

      UH, I HATE TO STEAL
          HER ANSWER,
       BUT I DON'T THINK
           HE NEEDS--
   HE'S NOT BAD AT ANYTHING.

         - OKAY. KELLY.
     - HE WOULD GET AN "A"
          IN FOREPLAY.
          - ALL RIGHT.

      - AND WAS THIS A "D"
           OR AN "F"?
   OR A "NEEDS IMPROVEMENT"?
           [laughter]

    - WELL, YOU WENT THERE.
NO, IT'S A "NEEDS IMPROVEMENT."
      "NEEDS IMPROVEMENT."
            - OKAY.
   OTHERWISE KNOWN AS AN "F"
         IN FREQUENCY.

          THAT'S WHAT.
        - HE NEEDS TO BE
      MORE FREQUENT IN...
            - MUCH.

           - MUCH...
        - MORE FREQUENT.
           [laughter]
       IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN
          MORE OFTEN.

        - BUT HE'S GREAT
      WHEN IT DOES HAPPEN.
        - WHEN IT DOES.
            - OKAY.
      - YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

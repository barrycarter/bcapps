             - OH!

            - WELL--
    - JARED, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
     - I'M REALLY--LET'S GO
    WITH WHAT DON SAID AND,

    YOU KNOW, GO DOWN SOUTH.
     ALTHOUGH I DO IT NOW,
           IT'S, UH--
      I WOULD SAY IT'S ONE
       OF HER FAVORITES.

           [laughter]
           - JILLIAN,
   SHOULD HE KEEP DOING THAT?
      ROLE-PLAYING, JARED.
     - I SAID ROLE-PLAYING.

     YOU GOT TO SPICE IT UP
         A LITTLE BIT.
  THAT MIGHT GET BORING AFTER
   25 YEARS OF BEING MARRIED.
   - WE'VE NEVER ROLE-PLAYED
            THOUGH.

        - YEAH, COME ON!
         - THAT'S WHY.
        - YOU'RE A COP!
 THERE'S SO MANY THINGS TO DO.

     DON'T TAKE ME TO JAIL,
            OFFICER.
            COME ON!
      - MIGHT HAVE TO TRY
      THAT TONIGHT THOUGH.

         - YOU ALREADY
    GOT THE UNIFORM, JARED.
      ALL RIGHT, JONATHAN?
    - I'M JUST GONNA GO OUT
   ON A LIMB AND SAY THE EAR.

      - SO SHE WOULD WANT
       MORE OF YOUR EARS?
         - YEAH, SHE--
           [laughter]
SHE WOULD WANT UNFETTERED ACCESS
          TO MY EARS.

  - SHE WOULD WANT UNFETTERED
      ACCESS TO YOUR EARS?
  - TO BITE THEM, TO TUG THEM,
  AND TO JUST GENERALLY--UGH.
     - WHAT IS STOPPING HER
  FROM GETTING TO THESE EARS?

             - ME.
           - REALLY?
       ARE YOU SENSITIVE?
       - IT GETS ANNOYING
         AFTER A WHILE.

           - REALLY?
         - JUST--UNGH!
    STOP TUGGING AT MY EARS.
        - OKAY, HOLLIE,
CAN YOU LEAVE THOSE EARS ALONE?

        WHAT'D YOU SAY?
   SHE SAID WITH HER ON TOP.
           [laughter]

      ALL RIGHT, HUSBANDS,
         NEXT QUESTION.
    ACCORDING TO YOUR WIFE,
     HOW OFTEN DID SHE SAY
     YOU FIND IT NECESSARY
    TO SPEND SOME ALONE TIME

     WITH YOUR BEST FRIEND
   WHO LIVES BELOW YOUR BELT?
             JARED?
     - I'D SAY ONCE A DAY.

         - ONCE A DAY?
    - DEFINITELY FEEL BETTER
        ONCE IT'S DONE.
           [laughter]

            - OKAY.
    JILLIAN, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
       FIVE TIMES A WEEK.

        - THAT'S CLOSE.
   - SO WE'RE TWO DAYS SHORT.
           - COME ON.
  YOU KNOW I DO IT EVERY DAY.

           - GOT YOU.
           JONATHAN?
            - FOUR.
            - FOUR?
        - LET'S GO FOUR.

       - WHAT'D YOU SAY?
         SHE SAID NONE.
   - I THOUGHT I WAS ENOUGH!

        - I HAVE NEEDS!
           [laughter]
    WE'RE GETTING DIVORCED,
           AREN'T WE?

             - NO.
        ALL RIGHT, DON,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
 - THIS ONE BETTER BE A LAY-UP.

          ONCE A DAY.
         - ONCE A DAY?
           ALL RIGHT.
   WHAT'D YOU SAY, ADRIANNA?

          - EVERY DAY.
          - THAT'S A--
         NO, THIS HAND.
           [applause]

   - LET'S SEE WHAT WE HAVE.
       DON AND ADRIANNA,

         TO 30 POINTS,

      SO ANYBODY CAN WIN.
         DON'T GO AWAY.
     [cheers and applause]

 Well the kids wanted a puppy,
     but they can be really
           expensive.
 So to save money I just found
         them a possum.

    Dad, I think he's dead.
 Probably just playin' possum.
       SFX: Possum hisses

          There he is.
 There's an easier way to save.

 could save you fifteen percent

   ALL RIGHT, ARE YOU READY?

  GENTLEMEN, HOW DID YOUR WIFE
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
    THE GUEST THAT TRAVELED
          THE FURTHEST
  TO OUR WEDDING WAS "BLANK,"

        WHILE THE GUEST
       I WOULD HAVE LIKED
        TO SHIP FAR AWAY
    WOULD HAVE BEEN "BLANK."
           JONATHAN?

 - THE GUEST THAT CAME FARTHEST
        AWAY WAS DEBBIE.
         SHE'S ENGLISH,
   SO SHE CAME FROM ENGLAND.
            - OKAY.

         - SO SHE CAME
    FROM THE FARTHEST AWAY.
      AND THE ONE TO GO--
       PUT FARTHEST AWAY
     WOULD HAVE BEEN CATHY.

          - WHY CATHY?
  - SHE'S A VERY LOVELY GIRL.
           [laughter]

          - ALL RIGHT.
      - BUT SHE'S LOVELY.

       HER BROTHER GLENN.

          - ALL RIGHT.
  - THEY CAME FROM CALIFORNIA.
          THE ONE THAT
        WOULD I WANT OUT

        WOULD EITHER BE
         MY COUSIN GREG
        OR HER SISTER'S
    NOW EX-BOYFRIEND JESSE.
  I JUST DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE
     SHE DOESN'T LIKE MORE.

           [laughter]
  I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY JESSE.
       - GLENN AND JESSE.

   JILLIAN, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
       - GLENN AND GREG.
 - GREG ALMOST BURNT MY DRESS!

       - I FORGOT HE DID.
        WE STILL GOT 15.
           [laughter]

           [applause]
     - YOU GOT HALF RIGHT.
        ALL RIGHT, DON,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?

   - WELL, THE ONE THAT CAME
       THE FURTHEST AWAY
      WAS HER FRIEND JOE.
   THE ONE WE'D SEND FURTHEST
          WOULD BE...

        I GUESS I'LL GO
      WITH MY FRIEND MATT.
       - SO JOE AND MATT.
   WHAT'D YOU SAY, ADRIANNA?

         JOE AND YOUR--
    AND MY DEAD BOSS'S SON.
     SO YOU GOT HALF RIGHT.
  - I ALMOST THOUGHT OF THAT.
         - BUT YOU GUYS
        ARE THE WINNERS.

          AND SHE FELT

      SHE IS GOING TO HATE
    THAT I SAID THAT ON TV,
     BUT I'LL GO WITH THAT.

   A FEAR OF VOMIT, YOU KNOW.
      AND SHE'S A TEACHER,
      SO SHE HAD A STUDENT
      ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW,
       VOMIT IN HER CLASS

  IT APPROPRIATELY, YOU KNOW.
        - OKAY, GOT YOU.
        ALL RIGHT, DAVE,

      SHE ACTUALLY TRIPPED
           AND LANDED
   BOTH HANDS DOWN ON CEMENT

     AND EVENTUALLY NEEDED

        SHE'D BE HOLDING
      A BLANK IN HER HAND

     WHAT DID YOUR HUSBAND
       SAY YOU WOULD RANK
         AS NUMBER ONE?

     SHE FELL ON HER FACE!"
           [laughter]
            TRAYCE?

   - OKAY, SO I'M EMBARRASSED
     EVEN TO JUST SAY THIS,
           BUT I HAVE
       A REALLY BAD HABIT

            OF, UM,
      PICKING MY TOENAILS
          IN THE BED,
   AND THEN I HAVE THIS THING

        WHERE I PUT 'EM
          TO THE SIDE,
    AND THEN I KIND OF LIKE
    BALL THEM UP, AND THEN--
       [audience groans]

            EAT 'EM.
       BUT, I MEAN, IT IS
      EMBARRASSING, BUT--
         - MAYBE THAT'S
     WHY YOU ARE SO SKINNY.

       YOU GOT TO STOP--
      THERE'S NO NUTRITION
          IN TOENAILS.
   NO PROTEIN, NOT ANYTHING.

           ALL RIGHT.
   KENNETH, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
       - I SAID HER FEAR
          OF VOMITING.
    -YOUR FEAR OF THE VOMIT.

       - YEAH, I'M SORRY.
             YEAH.
  - AND WHAT ABOUT YOU, NANCI?
         - WHEN I FELL
        WALKING MY DOG.

     - OH! WAS IT THE DOGS
      THAT MADE YOU FALL?
    - NO, IT'S THE SIDEWALK.
           [laughter]
        - THAT HAPPENS!

         THAT SIDEWALK,
 YOU'RE WALKING THE SIDEWALK--

REMEMBER THAT, BUT THAT'S OKAY.

     [cheers and applause]

          - ALL RIGHT.
            KENNETH?

   HOW DID YOUR WIFE COMPLETE
         THIS SENTENCE?

   MY HUSBAND PRIDES HIMSELF
       ON BEING ALL MAN,
  BUT I COULD SWEAR I MARRIED
    A WOMAN WHEN HE BLANKS.
             NICK?
       - WHEN I'M TIRED.

             UM...

     - I GET PRETTY GRUMPY
         WHEN I'M TIRED

      AND SHORT-TEMPERED,

        LIKE A BIG BABY.
        - OKAY, HEATHER,
        WHAT DO YOU SAY?

         - I SAID WHEN
      YOU'RE GETTING READY

    YOU KNOW, I LIKE TO MAKE
       SURE I'M--YOU KNOW
 HIT THE NOOKS AND THE CRANNIES
  AND I AM LOOKING APPROPRIATE
        BEFORE I LEAVE,

       AND SHE ALWAYS...
       DOES THE OPPOSITE.
       BUT I WOULD SAY--
     NO, I WAS JUST JOKING.
          I'M JOKING.
           - REALLY?

       - SHE DOESN'T HIT
  THE NOOKS AND THE CRANNIES?

   TRAYCE, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

    - YOU BETTER HE BE GLAD.
         - GETS READY.
    - I SAID IT TAKES A BIT
         TO GET READY.
          - ALL RIGHT!

     DAVE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
      - I'M GONNA SAY, UM,
        WHEN I COMPLAIN.
       SOMETIMES WE HAVE
    DIFFERENCE OF OPINIONS,

      I COMPLAIN AND I GET
     LITTLE LIKE, YOU KNOW,
        "WHAT'S WRONG?"
           [laughter]

             NANCI,
     DOES HE GET LIKE THAT?
       - NO, HE DOESN'T.
          I DON'T KNOW
    WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT.

         - YOU SAID...
       - WHEN HE CLEANS!
        'CAUSE HE CLEANS
      BETTER THAN A WOMAN.
            - YEAH.
      - ANY WOMEN I KNOW.

 - YOU CAN EAT IN MY BATHROOM.
           -OH, WOW!
      THAT'S PRETTY CLEAN.

    A LITTLE BIT OF STOMACH,
      SO MAYBE MY STOMACH.
            - OKAY.
   TRAYCE, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

     - I'M SO EMBARRASSED,
   BECAUSE I'M SUCH A CRIER,
       AND I WANT TO CRY,
    BUT I SAID HE'S PERFECT.
      - SHE SAID NOTHING.

 AND JUST LIKE ANY TYPICAL MOM
 I'M THRILLED WHEN MY CHAMPION

 I'M JUST ANOTHER MOM TRYING TO
 HELP HER CHAMPION WIN THE DAY.
       CHOBANI CHAMPIONS.
       WIN THE DAY.

       [ Kimi ] ATTI AND I
 HAD ALWAYS CALLED OREGON HOME.
        UNTIL I GOT A JOB
        IN THE BIG APPLE.
     ADJUSTING TO CITY LIFE
        WAS HARD FOR ME.

     AND BECOMING A FULLTIME
INDOOR CAT WASN'T EASY FOR ATTI.
      BUT WE HAD EACH OTHER
      AND HE HAD PURINA CAT CHOW
                   INDOOR.

     HE ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT.
    AND I KNEW HE WAS GETTING
      EVERYTHING  NEEDED
    TO STAY HEALTHY INDOORS.

  AND AFTER A COUPLE OF WEEKS,
  I KNEW WE WERE FINALLY HOME!
       <i>[ Female Announcer ]</i>

       [ Dad ] I'm usually
     checking up on my kids.
    But last year my daughter
     was checking up on me.
      I wasn't eating well.

        She's a dietitian
     and she suggested I try
BOOST Complete Nutritional Drink
    to help get the nutrition
         I was missing.

    Now I drink it every day,
   and I love the great taste.
       <i>[ Female Announcer ]</i>
           <i>BOOST has 26</i>

        <i>essential vitamins</i>

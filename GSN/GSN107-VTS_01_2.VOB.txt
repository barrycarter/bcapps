  GENTLEMEN, HOW DID YOUR WIFE
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
        ON MY HUSBAND'S
      SEXUAL REPORT CARD,
        HE'D GET AN "A"
     WHEN IT COMES TO BLANK

          BUT HE'D GET
     A "NEEDS IMPROVEMENT"
    WHEN IT COMES TO BLANK.
              JOE.

      - UH, I GUESS, UH...
         "SEX" WOULD BE
         THE FIRST ONE.
  - "A" WHEN IT COMES TO SEX.
            - "A"--

   "A" WHEN IT COMES TO SEX,
      AND THEN "FOREPLAY."
  - YOU NEED IMPROVEMENT ON...
    - I NEED TO IMPROVE ON F--
      I JUST GO FOR THE GOAL.

           [laughter]
          - ALL RIGHT.
     NANCY, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

    IMPROVEMENT ON ANYTHING.
           [cheering]
      - SHE'S DELUSIONAL.

     - YOU ALWAYS GIVE ME
  NICE BACK RUBS, AND IT'S...
    OKAY. THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

     - I'M SO SORRY, GUYS.
             OKAY.

    THAT'S--THAT'S NOT GOOD.
             OKAY.
           [laughter]

     I PROBABLY CAN'T TAKE
       THAT BACK, CAN I?
             - NO.
 - AND THEN "NEEDS IMPROVEMENT"
         ON FREQUENCY.
            - OKAY.

     KELLY, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
      AN "A" FOR FOREPLAY,
    AND "NEEDS IMPROVEMENT"
   ON FREQUENCY, SO YOU GOT--

        - THAT WAS GOOD!
     - YOU GOT HALF RIGHT!
       [cheers, applause]
      YOU ARE IN THE LEAD!

      ALL RIGHT, SHANNON,

   I WORUBBING HER FEET.R...

        OKAY, AND I WOULD
      "NEED IMPROVEMENT"--
      I DON'T THINK I NEED
    IMPROVEMENT ON ANYTHING.
          - ALL RIGHT.
      - SO NO IMPROVEMENT.

           - CIEMONE,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
       RUBBING YOUR FEET
          AND NOTHING!
     YOU GOT IT ALL RIGHT!

         - HERE WE GO.

    A MAN WALKS BY YOUR WIFE
     AND SAYS, "NICE PAIR."
         IS HE TALKING
        ABOUT HER EYES,
           HER LEGS,
         OR HER BOOBS?

            - WHOO.

           AT A GIRL?
           - GREGORY.
    - IT WOULD BE HER LEGS.

         NEXT QUESTION.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE--
         MY DOCTOR SAID
       I HAVE A CONDITION

   CALLED SELECTIVE HEARING,
WHICH EXPLAINS WHY WHEN MY WIFE
       TALKS ABOUT BLANK,
       IT GOES IN ONE EAR
       AND OUT THE OTHER.

   - I'LL GO WITH CLEANING UP
         MY, UH, MESS.
    EVERY TIME I COME HOME,
    I JUST THROW EVERYTHING

RIGHT ON THE SIDE OF THE BED...
         I DON'T KNOW--
  I'M GONNA WEAR IT THE NEXT--
LIKE, ESPECIALLY IF IT'S JUNKY,
 I'M GONNA WEAR IT THE NEXT DAY

    TO WAKE UP WITH OUR SON
          OR WHATNOT.

    AND THEN IN THE MORNING,

     I'M GONNA HAVE TO UN--
     YOU KNOW, GET IT ALL--

            - YEAH?
  - YEAH, I DON'T CLEAN IT UP.
           [laughter]
       - YOU JUST DON'T.

  - I DO AFTER DINNER. THAT'S
 THE ONLY TIME, BUT OTHERWISE,
    THE SINK JUST BUILDS UP,
      AND THEN I WASH 'EM.
            - TREY.

 - UM, MINE'S GONNA HAVE TO BE
         COMMUNICATION.
    YOU KNOW, SHE'S ALWAYS--
  "HEY, TALK TO ME ABOUT THIS.
           TALK TO ME
     ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS."

  I DON'T REALLY WANT TO TALK,
           YOU KNOW?
           [laughter]
   I'D RATHER PLAY MY GUITAR
    OR SOMETHING, YOU KNOW?

          THE KITCHEN.
             - OH.

   ACCORDING TO YOUR HUSBAND,

    WHICH PIECE OF FURNITURE
          IN YOUR HOME
     MOST CLOSELY RESEMBLES
          YOUR MOTHER?
             TAMIE.

         - DINETTE SET.

- DINETTE SET, BECAUSE IT'S REAL
     DAINTY, AND IT'S NICE,
  AND IT'S REALLY GIRLIE-GIRL.
           - MM-HMM.

 - AND MY MOM IS A GIRLIE GIRL.
   - GREGORY, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
     HE SAID OLD RECLINER.

        - YOU SHOULD'VE.
          OH, COME ON.
         - OKAY, LANIE,

- HOPEFULLY THIS IS EASY, 'CAUSE
 WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF MOVING,

  AND WE THREW EVERYTHING OUT
        BUT ONE THING--
     I HAVE A BEDROOM SET.
   BUT I WILL SAY, THAT DOES
      RESEMBLE MY MOTHER,

 BECAUSE IT'S CLEAN, IT'S NICE,
  IT'S FRESH, IT'S--YOU KNOW.

         OF THE BLANK.

            - YEAH?
    - HE'D STARVE TO DEATH.
         - OKAY. TAMIE.
           - ONE UP--
    HE CAN'T EVEN FRY BACON.

           [laughter]
        SO IT'S COOKING!
  - SO YOU'RE SAYING COOKING--

     LIKE, HE COOKS FOR ME
  SOMETIMES, BUT HE DOESN'T--
   IF WE RUN OUT OF SOMETHING
        AND HE NEEDS IT,
  HE'LL JUST EAT WHATEVER ELSE
          IS IN THERE,

    EVEN IF IT'S JUST, LIKE,
     SLICED HAM OR TURKEY.
            - YEAH.
    - LIKE, HE'LL EAT THAT,
      AND HE WON'T TELL ME
    THAT WE'RE OUT OF YOGURT

   OR SOMETHING THAT WE NEED,
SO I WOULD SAY GROCERY SHOPPING.

            - WHOO!
 - BUT DON'T WORRY, EVERYBODY,

       WE STILL GOT A LOT
      OF QUESTIONS TO GO.
        HERE'S THE FIRST
  OF OUR TEN-POINT QUESTIONS.
   GENTLEMEN, WHICH OF THESE
       DID YOUR WIFE SAY

     YOU PUSHED MORE OFTEN
         IN THE BEDROOM
       IN THE LAST WEEK--
       THE SNOOZE BUTTON,

        THE POWER BUTTON
        ON YOUR LAPTOP,
     OR YOUR WIFE'S BUTTON?
             TREY.

         - UH, PROBABLY
       THE SNOOZE BUTTON.
    YEAH, I'D PROBABLY GO--
 THAT'S PROBABLY THE BEST ONE.
         I DON'T KNOW.
      I'M NOT REALLY SURE.

         - OKAY, MANDY,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
           MY BUTTON.
             - OH.
         - BABE, WHAT?
          - I MEAN...

 - BUT, LIKE, LAST NIGHT AND...
         - OKAY, YEAH.

      ALL RIGHT, MICHAEL,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
     - THAT'S AN EASY ONE--
    DEFINITELY HER BUTTON...

            - YEAH?
        - ALL DAY LONG.
            - OKAY.
     LANIE, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
           MY BUTTON.
          - MY BUTTON.

        - COME ON, WHOO!
         - THERE WE GO.
            GREGORY.

       - UH, HER BUTTON.
         - HER BUTTON?
            - YEAH.
     - YOU KNOW YOU LYIN'.
      - THE SNOOZE BUTTON.

   - YOU'VE BEEN HITTING THAT
 SNOOZE BUTTON ALL--EVERY DAY,
 'CAUSE YOU'VE BEEN GETTING UP,
         GOING TO WORK,
         TALKING ABOUT,
     WE GONNA GO ON VACAY.

      - WE'RE ON VACATION.
 WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER MORNIN'?
   - YOU BETTER START TELLING
     THE TRUTH. YOU KNOW--
      - THAT'S THE TRUTH.
   - WE DON'T HAVE NO POINTS.

           [laughter]
           NO POINTS!
           [applause]
        - OH, HUSBANDS,
   HERE'S THE NEXT QUESTION.

       HOW DID YOUR WIFE
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
    HE MAY ACT LIKE THE BIG,
       STRONG PROTECTOR,
    BUT MY HUSBAND WOULD BE
     AS HELPLESS AS A CHILD

     IF I DIDN'T TAKE CARE
           OF BLANK.
            MICHAEL.
   - I'LL GO WITH EVERYTHING.

       UM, SHE'S REALLY--
   SHE'S REALLY LIKE MY ROCK.
     SHE HELPS ME OUT WITH
EVERYTHING. EVERYTHING I NEED--
LIKE, I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO LOOK,
       IT'S ALREADY DONE.

     SHE'S--SHE'S THE BEST,
    AND THAT'S WHY I THINK--
       IT MIGHT BE WRONG,
  BUT I'LL GO WITH EVERYTHING.
          - ALL RIGHT.
     WHAT'D YOU SAY, LANIE?

   - WELL, I KIND OF NARROWED
      IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT
     AND WENT WITH COOKING.
         - OH, COOKING.
      - COOKING. GREGORY.

 - I LIKE THAT COOKING ANSWER.
 - YOU LIKE THE COOKING ANSWER?
          - YES, I DO.

          - WAY TO GO.
       - YOU GOT POINTS!
           - OH, YES,
         WE GOT POINTS!

      - TAMIE IS SO HAPPY.
     - OH, THANK YOU, GOD.
   YOU KNOW WE WAS GONNA HAVE
        A BAD RIDE HOME.

          - ALL RIGHT,
     TREY, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
  - UM, I THINK THIS WAY EASY.
         I HOPE IT IS.
       UM, IT'S MY FACE,

BECAUSE I'M ALWAYS--SHE'S ALWAYS
     PLUCKING MY EYEBROWS,
  AND SHE BUYS ME ACNE LOTION.
    - MANDY, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

       GROCERY SHOPPING.
             - OH.
   - BUT HE'S--THAT'S RIGHT.
            - YEAH.
    - I THOUGHT OF THAT ONE
AND THIS ONE, BUT THAT'S RIGHT.

         - OKAY, HERE'S

    IS A TEN-STORY BUILDING
         WITH HER FEET
        BEING THE LOBBY,

  WHAT FLOOR DID YOUR WIFE SAY
       IS YOUR FAVORITE?
            GREGORY.
 - UH, THE--THE SEVENTH FLOOR.
      - THE SEVENTH FLOOR.

         - THAT'S ABOUT
    WHERE THE NICE RACK IS.
            - OKAY.

          - HOW COME?
      - THE BOOM-BOOMING.

  TO THAT BAD RIDE HOME, HUH?

           [laughter]
            - TREY?
 - UH, I'D SAY THE FIFTH FLOOR.

   SHE'S GOT THOSE LONG LEGS,
    YOU KNOW, AND SO RIGHT--
THOSE ARE LIKE ONE THROUGH FOUR.
           - UH-HUH.

 'CAUSE I REALLY LIKE HER BUTT.

          - ALL RIGHT.
            - YEAH.
  - FIFTH FLOOR. MANDY, WHAT'D
   YOU SAY? THE EIGHTH FLOOR.
          - MY BOOBS.
           - I MEAN--

 A DIRECTORY ON THIS ELEVATOR.
             UH...
 IS, LIKE, FIVE THE, YOU KNOW,
        DOWN LOW AND...

        - SO YOU SAID--
      YOU SAID FLOOR FIVE?
  - LET ME THINK FOR A SECOND,
 'CAUSE I REALLY LIKE UPSTAIRS,
     AND DOWNSTAIRS IS FUN
        TO HANG AROUND.

         I'LL GO WITH--
         I GUESS, LIKE,
   FOUR OR FIVE, YOU KNOW...
       - YOU--WHICH ONE?
         YOU NEED ONE.

      - FIVE--FLOOR FIVE.
          - ALL RIGHT.
     WHAT'D YOU SAY, LANIE?
   YOU SAID THE FIFTH FLOOR.

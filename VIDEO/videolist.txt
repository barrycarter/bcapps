A list of TV shows that I may or may not fastify. The [CODE] meanings:

  - [DONE]: Already "fastified" and available at
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDT-gV1lHjk&list=PLQiTKaefaTLoH9qlVCh7G091FD7d4IYm1
  -- may be available at
  http://www.dailymotion.com/dm_c8e4c905d2914a1e635acb339eab9138 but I
  am having trouble with dailymotion.com

  - [GETTING]: I am in the process of obtaining these series

  - [CANTGET]: Series that I am currently unable to obtain

  - [DONTWANT]: Series I am aware of that vaguely fit my "sitcoms from
  the 70s and 80s" rule, but that I do not plan to fastify.

  - [SPECIAL]: Special case with explanation following in brackets

  - [STILLGOING]: Series that are still in progress that I probably
  won't fastify until they end or I run out of other series; however,
  note the word "probably"

  - [NOT24]: Fewer than 24 episodes total exist of this series, which
  means it won't fill up even one screen; I am currently undecided re
  my followup for these series

  - (no tag): Has not yet been sorted into one of the categories above

Each countdown timer shows the time remaining until the date you choose, and, if you want, reveals a hidden content when this date is reached. Each countup timer shows the time elapsed since the date you choose or the time spent by the Internet user on the webpage.Easy Timer also allows you to schedule an automatic content modification.- [Documentation](http://www.kleor-editions.com/easy-timer)= Translators =- Chris K.

Set correctly your time zone via the WordPress Administration Panel if you have not done. You may occasionally specify an offset to [UTC time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) different from your time zone using the "offset" attribute:`[countdown date=YYYY/MM/DD-hh:mm:ss offset=x]Just [timer] until this film comes out in cinemas![/countdown]`The "offset" attribute is the offset (in hours) to UTC time. You can specify any relative number for this attribute. In some countries, the offset to UTC time is not constant. It may distort the calculation of the remaining time. To solve this problem, you can use the "offset" attribute (`offset=x` for each date during winter time and `offset=x+1` for each date during summer time, replace "x" with the right numeric value).The countdown timer shows the same remaining time everywhere in the world. When the date is reached, the content between `[countdown date=YYYY/MM/DD-hh:mm:ss]` and `[/countdown]` disappears. You can format this content as any content of your website.You can insert the `[timer]` shortcode as many times as you want between `[countdown date=YYYY/MM/DD-hh:mm:ss]` and `[/countdown]`.

date=2010/01/01//2011/01/01//2012/01/01//2013/01/01//2014/01/01]Just [remaining-timer] until 2010 and [total-remaining-timer] until 2014![after]For [elapsed-timer], we are in 2010!Just

[total-elapsed-timer], 2010 has arrived![/counter]`It is possible to specify a relative date for the "date" attribute, like this:`[counter date=+d:h:m:s]Just [remaining-timer]![after]Countdown ended![/counter]``[counter date=-d:h:m:s][after]Total time: [timer][/counter]`d = number of days, h = number of hours, m = number of minutes, s = number of secondsIn some cases, you can specify the duration differently:- `+d` is equivalent to `+d:0:0:0`- `+d:h` is equivalent to `+d:h:0:0`- `+d:h:m` is equivalent to `+d:h:m:0`- `-d` is equivalent to `-d:0:0:0`- `-d:h` is equivalent to `-d:h:0:0`- `-d:h:m` is equivalent to `-d:h:m:0`The date is then the date of the first display of the content by the Internet user, increased or decreased by the specified duration.Example:`[counter date=+0:0:2]Just [remaining-timer]![after]Countdown ended![/counter]`Another example:`[counter date=-0][after]Elapsed time since your first display of this page: [timer][/counter]`= Time And Date =To display the time, insert into your posts/pages/widgets a code like this:`It's [clock].`By default, the time is displayed in hours and minutes. If you want to display it in hours, minutes and seconds, use the "form" attribute and write `[clock form=hms]` instead of `[clock]`:`It's [clock form=hms].`The time is displayed according to the time zone of your website. Set correctly your time zone via the WordPress Administration Panel if you have not done. You may occasionally specify an offset to [UTC time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) different from your time zone using the "offset" attribute.To display the time of the Internet user:`It's [clock offset=local].`The "offset" attribute is the offset (in hours) to UTC time. You can specify any relative number for this attribute. You also can specify the "local" value to display the time of the Internet user. The "offset" attribute can be used for all shortcodes in the "Time and Date" and "Time Zone" sections.To display the year, insert into your posts/pages/widgets a code like this:`We are in [year].`By default, the year is displayed in 4 digits. If you want to display it in 2 digits, use the "form" attribute and write `[year form=2]` instead of `[year]`.To display the [ISO 8601](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) week number and year, insert into your posts/pages/widgets a code like this:`We are in the week [yearweek] of [isoyear].`To display the day number of the year, insert into your posts/pages/widgets a code like this:`Today, it's the day [yearday] of [year].`To display the month, insert into your posts/pages/widgets a code like this:`We are in [month].`By default, the month is displayed in letters, with the first letter capitalized. Use the "form" attribute and give the value:- "lower" to display it in lowercase letters- "upper" to display it in uppercase letters- "1" to display it as a number with 1 or 2 digits (1 digit for the first nine months of the year, 2 digits for the others)- "2" to display it as a number with 2 digits (first digit equal to 0 for the first nine months of the year)To display the day number of the month, insert into your posts/pages/widgets a code like this:`Today is [month] [monthday], [year].`By default, the day number of the month is displayed as a number with 1 or 2 digits (1 digit for the first nine days of the month, 2 digits for the others). If you want to display it as a number with 2 digits (first digit equal to 0 for the first nine days of the month), use the "form" attribute and write `[monthday form=2]` instead of `[monthday]`.To display the weekday, insert into your posts/pages/widgets a code like this:`Today is [weekday], [month] [monthday], [year].`By default, the weekday is displayed with the first letter capitalized. Use the "form" attribute and give the value:- "lower" to display it in lowercase letters- "upper" to display it in uppercase lettersExample:`Yesterday was [weekday offset=-24], [month offset=-24] [monthday offset=-24], [year offset=-24].Today is [weekday form=lower offset=0], [month form=lower offset=0] [monthday offset=0], [year offset=0].Tomorrow will be [weekday form=upper offset=24], [month form=upper offset=24] [monthday offset=24], [year offset=24].`= Time Zone =To display the time zone of your website, insert into your posts/pages/widgets a code like this:`The time zone of this website is [timezone].`The displayed time zone will be automatically updated each time you will change the time zone of your website.To display the time zone of the Internet user:`Your time zone is [timezone offset=local].`== Installation ==1.

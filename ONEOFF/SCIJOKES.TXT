From Susan Stepney (stepneys@logica.com)
I always love the "Doc Smith" approach to mathematics, where Our Hero
glances at an equation (sorry, "formula"), and instantly says "of
course...!"

My experience is usually more like "I don't know what on earth that means"
... scribble, scribble, scribble ... "Oh, yes, but what a weird way of
writing it" ... scribble, scribble, scribble ... "now *this* should be a
much clearer way" ... scribble, scribble, scribble ... "oh, it's identical
to what I started with.  But *now* I understand it."  I can't *read* maths,
I can only write it :-)

A colleague of mine put it better: "mathematics is not a spectator
sport".

This joke reminds me of an excercise actually given in the exam
in a course on combinatorics and discrete mathematics here at the
University of Oslo last year:

Calculate the number of ways 30 identical objects can be distributed
among 5 numbered containers with all containers nonempty in such a way
that containers 1, 3 and 5 contains an odd number of objects, and
containers 2 and 4 contains an even numbers.

Incredible, isn't it? I later heard that the number 30 was a typo. It
should have been an odd number.

a funny, but true story:

a friend of mine (2.5 years hasn't heard anything about mathematics)
saw in his first semester at university the following equation (taylor):

     f(x) =  ---- + ----- x + ...
              0!     1!
after reading the first ("0") he thought: "what's about the exclamation
mark? oh, i see: you can't divide by zero. attention!"
but after reading the second term ("1!") he wonders: "hey-oh, you *can*
divide by one!! what's this?!"
and after thinking a long time about the problem he comes to the real
meaning... ;-)

really, it's true!!!

 When Mathematicians Go Bad 

 "Psst, c'mere," said the shifty-eyed man wearing a long black
trenchcoat, as he beckoned me off the rainy street into a damp dark
alley.  I followed.

 "What are you selling?" I asked.

 "Geometrical algebra drugs."

 "Huh!?"

 "Geometry drugs.  Ya got your uppers, your downers, your sidewaysers, your
inside-outers..."

 "Stop right there," I interrupted.  "I've never heard of inside-
outers."

 "Oh, man, you'll love 'em.  Makes you feel like M.C. ever-lovin'
Escher on a particularly weird day."

 "Go on..."

 "OK, your inside-outers, your arbitrary bilinear mappers, and here,
heh, here are the best ones," he said, pulling out a large clear
bottle of orange pills.

 "What are those, then?" I asked.

 "Givens transformers.  They'll rotate you about more planes than you
even knew existed."

 "Sounds gross.  What about those bilinear mappers?"

 "There's a whole variety of them.  Here's one you'll love -- they call
it 'One Over Z' on the street.  Take one of these little bad boys and
you'll be on speaking terms with the Point at Infinity."

                      c
 On a lies a beermat and on c stands a glass. The mathematican has
to move the c to a. He takes the glas and puts it on the beermat.
Now the glas is put on point b and the mathematican has to move it
to a. The mathematican takes the glas and puts it on c - the problem
has been reduced to one already solved.

then there were mathematicians' brains which were currently fetching
$1000 per ounce.

HOW TO PUT AN ELEPHANT INTO A REFRIGERATOR:
Analysis:
1)  Differentiate it and put into the refrig.
    Then integrate it in the refrig.
2)  Redefine the measure on the referigerator (or the elephant).
3)  Apply the Banach-Tarsky theorem.


Number theory:
1)  First factorize, second multiply.
2)  Use induction.  You can always squeeze a bit more in.

Algebra:
1)  Step 1. Show that the parts of it can be put into the refrig.
    Step 2. Show that the refrig. is closed under the addition.
2)  Take the appropriate universal refrigerator and get
    a surjection from refrigerator to elephant.

Topology:
1)  Have it swallow the refrig. and turn inside out.
2)  Make a refrig. with the Klein bottle.
3)  The elephant is homeomorphic to a smaller elephant.
4)  The elephant is compact, so it can be put into a finite collection
    of refrigerators. That's usually good enough.
5)  The property of being inside the referigerator
    is hereditary.  So, take the elephant's mother,
    cremate it, and show that the ashes fit inside the refrigerator.
6)  For those who object to method 3 because it's cruel to animals.
    Put the elephant's BABY in the refrigerator.

Algebraic topology:
    Replace the interior of the refrigerator by its
    universal cover, R^3.

Linear algebra:
1)  Put just its basis and span it in the refrig.
2)  Show that 1% of the elephant will fit inside the refrigerator.
    By linearity, x% will fit for any x.

Affine geometry:
    There is an affine transformation putting the
    elephant into the refrigerator.

Set theory:
1)  It's very easy!
    refrigerator = { elephant } 2) The elephant and the interior of the
    refrigerator both have cardinality c.

Geometry:
    Declare the following:
      Axiom 1. An elephant can be put into a refrigerator.

Complex analysis:
    Put the refrig. at the origin
        and the elephant outside the unit circle.
    Then get the image under the inversion.

Numerical analysis:
1)  Put just its trunk and refer the rest to the error term.
2)  Work it out using the Pentium.

Statistics:
1)  bright statistician.
        Put its tail as a sample and say "Done."

2)  dull statistician.
        Repeat the experiment pushing the elephant to the refrig.

3)  Our NEW study shows that you CAN'T put the elephant
    in the refrigerator.

                         The History of 2 + 2 = 5
                             by Houston Euler

                "First and above all he was a logician.  At
                least thirty-five years of the half-century
                or so of his existence had been devoted
                exclusively to proving that two and two always
                equal four, except in unusual cases, where
                they equal three or five, as the case may be."

                        -- Jacques Futrelle, "The Problem of Cell 13"

Most mathematicians are familiar with -- or have at least seen references
in the literature to -- the equation 2 + 2 = 4. However, the less well
known equation 2 + 2 = 5 also has a rich, complex history behind it. Like
any other complex quantitiy, this history has a real part and an imaginary
part; we shall deal exclusively with the latter here.

Many cultures, in their early mathematical development, discovered the
equation 2 + 2 = 5. For example, consider the Bolb tribe, descended from
the Incas of South America. The Bolbs counted by tying knots in ropes. They
quickly realized that when a 2-knot rope is put together with another
2-knot rope, a 5-knot rope results.

Recent findings indicate that the Pythagorean Brotherhood discovered a
proof that 2 + 2 = 5, but the proof never got written up. Contrary to what
one might expect, the proof's nonappearance was not caused by a cover-up
such as the Pythagoreans attempted with the irrationality of the square
root of two. Rather, they simply could not pay for the necessary scribe
service. They had lost their grant money due to the protests of an
oxen-rights activist who objected to the Brotherhood's method of
celebrating the discovery of theorems. Thus it was that only the equation 2
+ 2 = 4 was used in Euclid's "Elements," and nothing more was heard of 2 +
2 = 5 for several centuries.

Around A.D. 1200 Leonardo of Pisa (Fibonacci) discovered that a few weeks
after putting 2 male rabbits plus 2 female rabbits in the same cage, he
ended up with considerably more than 4 rabbits. Fearing that too strong a
challenge to the value 4 given in Euclid would meet with opposition,
Leonardo conservatively stated, "2 + 2 is more like 5 than 4." Even this
cautious rendition of his data was roundly condemned and earned Leonardo
the nickname "Blockhead." By the way, his practice of underestimating the
number of rabbits persisted; his celebrated model of rabbit populations had
each birth consisting of only two babies, a gross underestimate if ever
there was one.

Some 400 years later, the thread was picked up once more, this time by the
French mathematicians.  Descartes announced, "I think 2 + 2 = 5; therefore it
does."  However, others objected that his argument was somewhat less than
totally rigorous.  Apparently, Fermat had a more rigorous proof which was to
appear as part of a book, but it and other material were cut by the editor so
that the book could be printed with wider margins.

Between the fact that no definitive proof of 2 + 2 = 5 was available and
the excitement of the development of calculus, by 1700 mathematicians had
again lost interest in the equation. In fact, the only known 18th-century
reference to 2 + 2 = 5 is due to the philosopher Bishop Berkeley who, upon
discovering it in an old manuscript, wryly commented, "Well, now I know
where all the departed quantities went to -- the right-hand side of this
equation." That witticism so impressed California intellectuals that they
named a university town after him.

But in the early to middle 1800's, 2 + 2 began to take on great
significance. Riemann developed an arithmetic in which 2 + 2 = 5,
paralleling the Euclidean 2 + 2 = 4 arithmetic. Moreover, during this
period Gauss produced an arithmetic in which 2 + 2 = 3. Naturally, there
ensued decades of great confusion as to the actual value of 2 + 2. Because
of changing opinions on this topic, Kempe's proof in 1880 of the 4-color
theorem was deemed 11 years later to yield, instead, the 5-color theorem.
Dedekind entered the debate with an article entitled "Was ist und was soll
2 + 2?"

Frege thought he had settled the question while preparing a condensed
version of his "Begriffsschrift." This condensation, entitled "Die Kleine
Begriffsschrift (The Short Schrift)," contained what he considered to be a
definitive proof of 2 + 2 = 5. But then Frege received a letter from
Bertrand Russell, reminding him that in "Grundbeefen der Mathematik" Frege
had proved that 2 + 2 = 4. This contradiction so discouraged Frege that he
abandoned mathematics altogether and went into university administration.

Faced with this profound and bewildering foundational question of the value
of 2 + 2, mathematicians followed the reasonable course of action: they
just ignored the whole thing. And so everyone reverted to 2 + 2 = 4 with
nothing being done with its rival equation during the 20th century. There
had been rumors that Bourbaki was planning to devote a volume to 2 + 2 = 5
(the first forty pages taken up by the symbolic expression for the number
five), but those rumor remained unconfirmed. Recently, though, there have
been reported computer-assisted proofs that 2 + 2 = 5, typically involving
computers belonging to utility companies. Perhaps the 21st century will see
yet another revival of this historic equation.

From: "Matt Westwood" <Mattwestwood@btinternet.com>
Footnote from Matt Westwood in the 21st century:
It's got to be pointed out that 2.4 + 2.4 = 4.8
so rounding to the nearest integer, 2+2=5.

THE STORY OF BABEL:

In the beginning there was only one kind of Mathematician, created by
the Great Mathematical Spirit form the Book: the Topologist.  And they
grew to large numbers and prospered.

One day they looked up in the heavens and desired to reach up as far
as the eye could see.  So they set out in building a Mathematical
edifice that was to reach up as far as "up" went.  Further and further
up they went ... until one night the edifice collapsed under the
weight of paradox.

The following morning saw only rubble where there once was a huge
structure reaching to the heavens.  One by one, the Mathematicians
climbed out from under the rubble.  It was a miracle that nobody was
killed; but when they began to speak to one another, SUPRISE of all
surprises! they could not understand each other.  They all spoke
different languages.  They all fought amongst themselves and each went
about their own way.  To this day the Topologists remain the original
Mathematicians.

Infinity joke of the week

A very large mathematical convention was held in Las Vegas.  The
conventioneers filled two hotels, each with an infinite number of rooms.
 The hotels were across the street from each other and were owned by
brothers.  One evening, while everyone was out at a bar-b-que, one of the
hotels burned to the ground.  The brothers got together and worked out a
plan.  In the remaining hotel, they moved all guests to twice their room
number -- room 101 moved to 202, room 1234 moved to room 2468, etc.  Then
all the odd number rooms were empty, and there were an infinite number of
odd rooms.  So the guests from the other hotel moved into them.

Collage 292           H u m o u r N e t            4 SEP 96

On a mailing list this size, not every Collage is going to appeal to
every subscriber. But the ones that seem to appeal to the fewest
people are my "geek humor" Collages. (Even political humor probably
enjoys a broader appeal.) Nevertheless, they are so thoroughly loved
by the geeks in the audience that they've become a mainstay of
HumourNet. Alas, the moderator has no choice but to accommodate the
vocal minority ...

("And your moderator, being such a happy geek, is a piece of cake.")

And when I say "minority," I mean *MINORITY*. There are painfully
few people out there who really understand geekdom -- especially
geek employment. It's so bad that smart geeks know better than to
even *discuss* their jobs, for fear of having to perform emergency
resuscitation on anyone within earshot.

Not a problem, though -- the *creative* ones simply make up other,
more interesting lines of work. Ideally, these lines of work are
tailored to the audience. For example, there's no sense in trying to
explain the fundamentals of foliage-penetrating radar to members of
the college field-hockey team. No, it's much better, in that
particular case, to be a gynecologist for the FBI.


(You're probably starting to see how I get myself into trouble....)

Well, I'm not the only one who gets creative when the field hockey
team (or gymnastics team or what have you) shows up at the local bar.
And, to illustrate this, Jon in Rockford, Illinois, sent me the
following excerpt from a thread that surfaced on a graphic-design
list to which he subscribes; since the conversation evolves in a
nice, simple fashion, I'll just label the speakers A, B, and C:

A: When in conversation with a stranger, how do you explain what you
A: do in a single sentence?

B: It takes so long for me to really describe all the aspects of my
B: work [that] I can even bore myself sometimes.
B: I usually reply, "I sing in a band."
B: The conversation gets much funnier that way.

C: I know that one. I've built up a repertoire of such answers:

C: I'm an Elvis impersonator.
C: I'm an otter trainer.
C: I rob gas stations, liquor stores, that sort of thing.
C: I'm between jobs.
C: Well right now, I'm the dictator of a small South American
C: country, but soon I'll control all of Latin America and then the
C: Western hemisphere and then -- I'LL RULE THE WORLD! [maniacal
C: laughter]

C: (Just the ones I use most often.)

Note how it's easier to develop a more-or-less normal conversation
as the maniacal dictator of a small South American (or Latin
American) country than it is to explain that you're a graphic
designer (or engineer or, for that gymnastics team, really anything
that requires at least a two-year degree) (not that I'm not being
critical, mind you -- they still look awfully cute as they bounce
across the floor). In other words, Manuel Noriega probably has an
easier time meeting members of the field-hockey team than, say, the
average mechanical-engineering major. And Noriega's serving 40 years
for drug trafficking. (Come to think of it, he probably has a *much*
easier time of it.)

OTOH, it's a well-established fact that MEs have very underdeveloped
conversational skills ... ;-)

BTW, my own personal favorite out of that list is "otter trainer";
not because it's the one I use most often, but because I think it's
the only one I *haven't* used [yet].

There are very good reasons why we need to do this -- probably the
single most convincing is that, quite simply, no one is interested
in geek employment. As "B" noted, above, it's so boring, even *we're*
not interested.

But that's not the worst of it. No, the worst is *geek humor*.
Boring jobs aside, your standard geek (yes, that'd be ANSI standard)
can't resist an opportunity to make a comment that only another geek
would understand -- much less find *amusing*.

Among geeks, it's more than just sport; it's religion.

And, hence, the geek-humor Collages. And the follow-up comments
that they [unfortunately ;-)] generate ...

Collage 279 (the most recent "Geeks!" Collage) contained the
following piece:

     ... Engineers like to solve problems. If there are no
     problems handily available, they will create their own
     problems. Normal people don't understand this concept;
     they believe that if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
     Engineers believe that if it ain't broke, it doesn't have
     enough features yet.

Marc (in Maryland) felt compelled to clarify this a little:

     Actually, if it ain't broke, we need to take it apart to
     find out why.

Which, of course, also applies to things that *are* broken -- hence,
the engineer's proclivity for disassembling virtually everything in
sight. It's genetic -- *geek* genetics.

And so, we come to probably the single geekiest of all the geek-humor
Collages I've ever produced -- and all with thanks to:

Richard in Phoenix, Arizona, for "Math Riots Prove Fun Incalculable";

Jerry in Bellevue, Washington, for "A Modest Proposal";

and Umid in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, for "Career Choices,"
"Engineers, Scientists, and Mathematicians, Take One," and
"... Take Two."

Huge thanks to all the guilty parties. Here's one for the geek
history books ...

Enjoy! (But if you do, don't admit it to anyone. ;-)

SUBJ: Math Riots Prove Fun Incalculable
By Eric Zorn

(The following column appeared in the Chicago Tribune/DuPage County
edition, Tuesday June 29 1993 page 2-1)

News Item (June 23) -- Mathematicians worldwide were excited and
pleased today by the announcement that Princeton University
professor Andrew Wiles had finally proved Fermat's Last Theorem, a
365-year-old problem said to be the most famous in the field.

Admittedly, there was rioting and vandalism last week during the
celebration. A few bookstores had windows smashed and shelves
stripped, and vacant lots glowed with burning piles of old
dissertations. But overall we can feel relief that it was nothing
-- nothing -- compared to the outbreak of exuberant thuggery that
occurred in 1984 after Louis DeBranges finally proved the Bieberbach
Conjecture.

"Math hooligans are the worst," said a Chicago Police Department
spokesman. "But the city learned from the Bieberbach riots. We
were ready for them this time."

When word hit Wednesday that Fermat's Last Theorem had fallen, a
massive show of force from law enforcement at universities all
around the country headed off a repeat of the festive looting sprees
that have become the traditional accompaniment to triumphant
breakthroughs in higher mathematics.

Mounted police throughout Hyde Park kept crowds of delirious wizards
at the University of Chicago from tipping over cars on the midway as
they first did in 1976 when Wolfgang Haken and Kenneth Appel cracked
the long-vexing Four-Color Problem. Incidents of textbook-throwing
and citizens being pulled from their cars and humiliated with
difficult story problems last week were described by the
university's math department chairman Bob Zimmer as "isolated."

Zimmer said, "Most of the celebrations were orderly and peaceful.
But there will always be a few -- usually graduate students -- who
use any excuse to cause trouble and steal. These are not true fans
of Andrew Wiles."

Wiles himself pleaded for calm even as he offered up the proof that
there is no solution to the equation x^n + y^n = z^n when n is a
whole number greater than two, as Pierre de Fermat first proposed in
the 17th Century. "Party hard but party safe," he said, echoing the
phrase he had repeated often in interviews with scholarly journals
as he came closer and closer to completing his proof.

Some authorities tried to blame the disorder on the provocative
taunting of Japanese mathematician Yoichi Miyaoka. Miyaoka thought
he had proved Fermat's Last Theorem in 1988, but his claims did not
bear up under the scrutiny of professional referees, leading some to
suspect that the fix was in. And ever since, as Wiles chipped away
steadily at the Fermat problem, Miyaoka scoffed that there would be
no reason to board up windows near universities any time soon; that
God wanted Miyaoka to prove it.

In a peculiar sidelight, Miyaoka recently took the trouble to secure
a U.S. trademark on the equation "x^n + y^n = z^n " as well as the
now-ubiquitous expression "Take that, Fermat!" Ironically, in
defeat, he stands to make a good deal of money on cap and T-shirt
sales.

This was no walk-in-the-park proof for Wiles. He was dogged, in the
early going, by sniping publicity that claimed he was seen puttering
late one night doing set theory in a New Jersey library when he
either should have been sleeping, critics said, or focusing on
arithmetic algebraic geometry for the proving work ahead.

"Set theory is my hobby, it helps me relax," was his angry
explanation. The next night, he channeled his fury and came up with
five critical steps in his proof. Not a record, but close.

There was talk that he thought he could do it all by himself,
especially when he candidly referred to University of California
mathematician Kenneth Ribet as part of his "supporting cast," when
most people in the field knew that without Ribet's 1986 proof
definitively linking the Taniyama Conjecture to Fermat's Last
Theorem, Wiles would be just another frustrated guy in a tweed
jacket teaching calculus to freshmen.

His travails made the ultimate victory that much more explosive for
math buffs. When the news arrived, many were already wired from
caffeine consumed at daily colloquial teas, and they took to the
streets en masse shouting, "Obvious! Yessss! It was obvious!"

The law cannot hope to stop such enthusiasm, only to control it.
Still, one has to wonder what the connection is between wanton
pillaging and a mathematical proof, no matter how long-awaited and
subtle.

The Victory Over Fermat rally, held on a cloudless day in front of a
crowd of 30,000 (police estimate: 150,000) was pleasantly peaceful.
Signs unfurled in the audience proclaimed Wiles the greatest
mathematician of all time, though partisans of Euclid, Descartes,
Newton, and C.F. Gauss and others argued the point vehemently.

A warm-up act, The Supertheorists, delighted the crowd with a ragged
song, "It Was Never Less Than Probable, My Friend," which included
such gloating, barbed verses as --- "I had a proof all ready / But
then I did a choke-a / Made liberal assumptions / Hi! I'm Yoichi
Miyaoka."

In the speeches from the stage, there was talk of a dynasty,
specifically that next year Wiles will crack the great unproven
Riemann Hypothesis ("Rie-peat! Rie-peat!" the crowd cried), and
that after the Prime-Pair Problem, the Goldbach Conjecture ("Minimum
Goldbach," said one T-shirt) and so on.

They couldn't just let him enjoy his proof. Not even for one day.
Math people. Go figure 'em.

Theory finally coalesces ... </vs>]

SUBJ: A Modest Proposal
By Shannon Weston, University of Washington
(Reprinted on HumourNet with [indirect] permission)

[Editor's Note: According to Jerry, who is a faculty member at UW,
Shannon is a real student, and actually submitted this letter to
his teaching assistant. Jerry and the TA agreed that Shannon should
probably be in the marketing program. Heh. And they said that *I*
should be in the English Department. Of course, it was only the
*engineering* professors who were saying that.... ;-) </vs>]

Dear Sir,

I am presently enrolled in three math courses, one of which is your
linear algebra class. Naturally, the generous helpings of weighty
concepts presented thrice weekly occupy much of my thoughts -- a
fact which, owing to several recent close calls at pedestrian
crossings, seemed to be something of a mixed blessing. That is,
until last weekend. At about 10 o'clock Sunday evening, as I was
struggling to smear a facade of rigor over my EE235 homework, it
suddenly occurred to me how many names are attached to the familiar
methods, functions, etc. of college mathematics.

By "names" of course I do not mean technical designations in
general, but actual human names. Consider for a moment the fact
that mundane mathematical methods of the sort that are ladled out
daily in high school are rarely, if ever, named. The common man, it
seems, would not tolerate the obstruction incurred by lugging around
five-syllable German family names for simple functions -- thus we
have the "sine" and not the "Hohenhelmwohler function". However,
once that unsuspecting citizen enters the halls of academe, shielded
from the prying eyes and tender sensibilities of the public, a
continuous acclimating process works on him with every math course
he takes until, only two years later, he is regularly exposed to and
blandly accepts from mathematicians brazen self-promotion of a
degree unheard of outside the rap music industry.

It is NOT my purpose to pronounce ethical judgments on my betters,
particularly when they are intellectuals of Gauss' or Dirac's
standing. Even geniuses are bound by the constraints of the flesh
-- they must eat, and in order to do so they must be able to market
their product. Therefore Gauss' name appears in my text for much
the same reason that Kalvin Klein's appears on the rumps of anorexic
models. It IS my purpose to call your attention to a significant
difference between the two gentlemen: Klein is alive and Gauss is
dead. He is dead and, to the best of my knowledge, neither he nor
his estate hold any legal claim to his functions, processes, proofs,
etc. Moreover, not only is Gauss dead, but so is Dirac, Fourier and
the rest -- all of the mathematical geniuses of our race have been
culled by the brutal hand of natural selection at traffic crossings
and the like, and all them before they had the chance to secure a
solid legal claim to so much as a hyperbolic trig function.

Sir, I submit to you that we are sitting on a gold mine. The
commercial opportunities at hand beggar the imagination. At any
given time tens of thousands of our nation's youth are obliged to
study mathematics. These are generally well financed, perhaps a
touch naive, and, to put it gently, more study math than want to.
We know their demographics and what they are inclined to buy. A
captive audience, more ripe for exploitation would be hard to
imagine. Picture the typical student, bent over his text for hours
at a time. Imagine the results if, instead of the old math, he was
staring at (your product here):

      BEFORE                     AFTER
  Gassian elimination        Guiness Stout Elimination(tm)
  eigenvalues                Fritovalues(tm)
  Wronskian determinants     Shaquillian Determinants(tm)
  L'Hopital's rule           Honda Rules(tm)
  improper integrals         Victoria's Secret Integrals(tm)
  Laplace transform          Lifestyles transform(tm)
  Nortan equivalent          No-Doz Equivalent(tm)

... and so on. Of course this is just the tip of the iceberg. How
much do you think McDonald's would pony up to get theta replaced
with the golden arches? If we make too much money, we can always
plow some of the math back as a tax shelter:

    Y = sin (official function of the '96 Olympics) X

I'm sure you are every bit as intrigued as I am. Think it over ...

[Editor's Note: Unconfirmed, unsubstantiated, and unreliable (and,
nevertheless, quoted here) rumor has it that this student failed the
math course, but passed the business course -- and later went on to
found a large software corporation somewhere in the northwestern
U.S.... ;-) </vs>]

SUBJ: Engineers, Scientists, and Mathematicians, Take Two

An engineer, a physicist, and a mathematician are shown a pasture
with a herd of sheep, and told to put them inside the smallest
possible amount of fence.

The engineer is first. He herds the sheep into a circle and then
puts the fence around them, declaring, "A circle will use the least
fence for a given area, so this is the best solution."

The physicist is next. He creates a circular fence of infinite
radius around the sheep, and then draws the fence tight around the
herd, declaring, "This will give the smallest circular fence around
the herd."

The mathematician is last. After giving the problem a little
thought, he puts a small fence around himself and then declares, "I
define myself to be on the outside."

                            MATHEMATICAL THESIS

Here are a few relatively unexplored areas of mathematics which you may want
to use as the subject of your dissertation or thesis:

1.) To impose a new integer between 5 and 6 (which would of course be called
'fix').  We'll have to go through all of algebra, trig., calculus, and other
areas of mathematics to make them consistent (you could say we will be
putting in the fix).

2.) You know how they say that you can't compare apples and oranges? Well
now you can now (sort of).  I've done extensive investigating in this area
and here's what I've come up with:

Apples = K(O)* (1/8)Int[tan(O^2) + xsqrt(O) + 1) + (1/4)exp(J)]

Where J is the juice-ocity factor and O is the dependant variable Oranges.
Now I'm fairly certain everything in the equation is right but I don't know
what K(O) is -- this is the function of O we still have to work out.

3.) The ancient Pythagoreans left one big puzzle unsolved.  They like any
learned people since the earliest days of Western civilization sought to
quantify human experience and knowledge in precise mathematical terms.
Here's what they were able to put in numbers:
Justice=4, Marriage=7.  I have also discovered that Women=Sqrt(2)
(completely irrational), The meaning of life=42, and Pure Evil=17.  Still
unknown are the numbers for Sex, Anger, Polygamy, Dignity, Pain, Ice Cream,
Bastards, Farts, and just about everything else.

I found this paragraph in my textbook, "Analytical Mechanics" 6th Ed.,
Fowles and Cassiday. Buried in Appendix I, "Software Tools" :

"...many [mathematical software programs] suffer deficiencies common to
most technical user manuals: frequently they are poorly organized and
poorly written; almost invariably they are loaded with undefined cryptic
jargon; critical information is sometimes buried away in unsuspected
locations; and rarely do they perform well as a tutorial for the novice
user. [...] the Mathematica manual is afflicted with most of the
aforementioned ills. Indeed, its writers seem to have worked hard at
rendering their otherwise excellent product unuseable. That is succumbs to
these potential shortcomings should have been instantly obvious when we
opened it. On turning over the gorgeous-looking cover of the extremely
weighty manual to expose what we thought would be the first page, we found
instead, much to our dismay, the last page written upside down! The book
had been misbound! Fortunately, the text proved invariant under a 180
degree rotation of the x-axis. We guessed perhaps, that being in the
business of mathematical computation, the manufacturer meant this as a
test exercise for the novice user."

This is a joke some maths-professor of Oxford told, and his colleagues were
laughing their heads off:

In a Scottish village the rumour runs that one of them will travel to London.
Mr. Dunn appears on the doorstep of the future traveller and asks him to do
him a favour:
"Listen, my son Neal lives in London, and we have not had a message from him
for two years.
All I have is his address, London WC3."
"I sure will find him," says the traveller and tucks away the scrap of paper
Mr. Dunn holds out to him.
When the traveller arrives at the airport of London he sees a sign "WC",
says "aha",
enters,
counts the cabins: one two three,
knocks on door number three,
and asks: "Are you Nealy Dunn?"
"Yes," is the answer from the inside
"but I ran out of paper!"
"Aw, that is a bad excuse for not writing to your parents for such a long
time!!!!"

                          PROOFS THAT P

                  (attributed to Hartry Field)

Davidson's proof that p: Let us make the following bold conjecture: p

Wallace's proof that p: Davidson has made the following bold conjecture: p

Grunbaum:  As I have asserted again and again in previous publications, p.

Morgenbesser: If not p, what? q maybe?

Putnam:  Some philosophers have argued that not-p, on the grounds that q.
It would be an interesting exercise to count all the fallacies in this
"argument".  (It's really awful, isn't it?)  Therefore p.

Rawls:  It would be a nice to have a deductive argument that p from
self-evident premises.  Unfortunately, I am unable to provide one.  So
I will have to rest content with the following intuitive considerations
in its support: p.

Unger:  Suppose it were the case that not-p.  It would follow from
this that someone knows that q.  But on my view, no one knows anything
whatsoever.  Therefore p.  (Unger believes that the louder you say
this argument the more persuasive it becomes.)

Katz:  I have seventeen arguments for the claim that p, and I know
of only four for the claim that not-p.  Therefore p.

Lewis:  Most people find the claim that not p completely obvious and
when I assert p they give me an incredulous stare.  But the fact
that they find not-p obvious is no argument that it is true; and I
do not know how to refute an incredulous stare.  Therefore p.

Fodor:  My argument for p is based on three premises:
(1) q
(2) r
and
(3) p
>From these, the claim that p deductively follows.

Some people may find the third premise controversial, but it is
clear that if we replaced that premise by any other reasonable
premise, the argument would go through just as well.

Sellars's proof that p:  Unfortunately, limitations of space prevent
it from being included here, but important parts of the proof can be
found in each of the articles in the attached bibliography.

Earman:  There are solutions to the field equations of general
relativity in which space-time has the structure of a four-dimensional
klein bottle and in which there is no matter.  In each such
space-time, the claim that not-p is false.  Therefore p.

                                Saul Kripke

Some philosophers have argued that not-p.  But none of them seems to me
to have made a convincing argument against the intuitive view that
this is not the case.  Therefore, p.

[footnote].  This outline was prepared hastily--at the editor's
insistence---from a taped transcript of a lecture.  Since I was
not even given the opportunity to revise the first draft before
publication, I cannot be held responsible for any lacunae in the
(published version of the) argument, or for any fallacious or
garbled inferences resulting from faulty preparation of the
typescript.  Also, the argument now seems to me to have problems
which I did not know when I wrote it, but which I can't discuss
here, and which are completely unrelated to any criticisms that
have appeared in the literature (or that I have seen in manuscript);
all such criticisms misconstrue the argument.  It will be noted
that the present version of the argument seems to presuppose the
(intuitionistically unacceptable) law of double negation.  But the
argument can easily be reformulated in a way that avoids employing
such an inference rule.  I hope to expand on these matters further
in a separate monograph.


Routley and Meyer:  If (q & not-q) is true, then there is a model for p.
Therefore p.

Theorem: 1 is the smallest positive number
Proof:
Let the smallest postive number be called x.

x squared is also positive, therefore
	x^2 >= x

We can divide both sides by the positive number x

therefore
	x >= 1

Theorem : All positive integers are equal.
Proof : Sufficient to show that for any two positive integers, A and B,
   A = B.  Further, it is sufficient to show that for all N > 0, if A
   and B (positive integers) satisfy (MAX(A, B) = N) then A = B.

   Proceed by induction.

   If N = 1, then A and B, being positive integers, must both be 1.
   So A = B.

   Assume that the theorem is true for some value k.  Take A and B
   with MAX(A, B) = k+1.  Then  MAX((A-1), (B-1)) = k.  And hence
   (A-1) = (B-1).  Consequently, A = B.

This can also be written as:

     4a - 3a + 4b - 3b = 4c - 3c

After reorganising:

     4a + 4b - 4c = 3a + 3b - 3c

Take the constants out of the brackets:

     4 * (a+b-c) = 3 * (a+b-c)

The aim is to proove that 1 = 2.
 
Notice the following:
 
                  1 = 1^1 = 1
              2 + 2 = 2^2 = 4
          3 + 3 + 3 = 3^2 = 9
      4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 4^2 = 16
 
and in general:
 
     x + x + ..... + x = x^2
     \___ x times ___/
 
Derive in place:
 
     1 + 1 + ..... + 1 = 2 x
     \___ x times ___/
 
       1 * x = 2 x
 
Simplify by x which is not zero, 1 = 2.
 
Note the formula is valid for pure fractionals too, for example:

0.05 + 0.05 + 0.05 + 0.05 + 0.05 = 
0.01 * (5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5) = 0.01 * 5^2 = 0.05 ^2 = 0.25
 
and thus it is valid for any real number x because we can always write x as
a sum of a pure integer u and a pure fractional v: x = u+v. For example
x=3.8 => u=3 and v=0.8. So we are not deriving in a discrete space, think
somewhere else.

Theorem: In any finite set of women, if one has blue eyes then they
all have blue eyes.

Proof. Induction on the number of elements.

if n= or n=1 it is immediate.

Assume it is true for k

Consider a group with k+1 women, and without loss of generality assume
the first one has blue eyes. I will represent one with blue eyes with
a '*' and one with unknown eye color as @.

You have the set of women:

{*,@,...,@} with k+1 elements. Consider the subset made up of the first
k. This subset is a set of k women, of which one has blue eyes. By
the induction hypothesis, all of them have blue eyes. We have then:

{*,...,*,@}, with k+1 elements. Now consider the subset of the last k
women. This is a set of k women, of which one has blue eyes (the next-to-last
element of the set), hence they all have blue eyes, in particular
the k+1-th woman has blue eyes.

Hence all k+1 women have blue eyes.

By induction, it follows that in any finite set of women, if one has
blue eyes they all have blue eyes. QED

Aren't multi-valued functions fun?  Once you realize what's going on,
though, you can make them into silly proofs pretty much without thinking.

Here's one I just made up:

Object: to prove that  i < 0  ( that is, sqrt(-1) < 0  )

Well, ( .5 + sqrt(3/4)*i )^3 = (-1)^3

                (most would assert this to be a false statement -- mostly
                 cuz they'll get the math wrong.  It's a true statement.
                 It's the next statement that is false.)

which means that .5 + sqrt(3/4)*i = -1

So then      1 + sqrt(3)*i = -2

             sqrt(3)*i = -1

             i = -1/sqrt(3)

Therefore i is a negative number.  QED.

(a - t/2)^2 = (b - t/2)^2
a - t/2 = b - t/2
a = b

So all numbers are the same, and math is pointless.

266...6/666...65 = 2/5, 499...9/999...8 = 4/8.

Another false proof for a correct result:

Reduce:   1 - x^2      1 - x

         (1 + x)^2     1 + x

From: Lynn Killingbeck <killbeck@pointecom.net>

This works for all n. 
Reduce:   1 - x^n      1 - x 
         ---------  =  ----- 
         (1 + x)^n     1 + x


Proof is by induction.
For n=1,
        (1-x^1)/(1+x)^1 = (1-x)/(1+x), by cancelling the '1' in the exponents.
For n=2, ditto by cancelling the '2' in the exponent.

It's true for n=1, and from there for n==>n+1=2, so must be true for all
n. QED

Theorem: n=n+1
Proof:
(n+1)^2 = n^2 + 2*n + 1

Bring 2n+1 to the left:
(n+1)^2 - (2n+1) = n^2

Substract n(2n+1) from both sides and factoring, we have:
(n+1)^2 - (n+1)(2n+1) = n^2 - n(2n+1)

Adding 1/4(2n+1)^2 to both sides yields:
(n+1)^2 - (n+1)(2n+1) + 1/4(2n+1)^2 = n^2 - n(2n+1) + 1/4(2n+1)^2

This may be written:
[ (n+1) - 1/2(2n+1) ]^2 = [ n - 1/2(2n+1) ]^2

Taking the square roots of both sides:
(n+1) - 1/2(2n+1)  = n - 1/2(2n+1)

Add 1/2(2n+1) to both sides:
n+1 = n

Theorem: log(-1) = 0
Proof:

On the other hand:

Theorem: ln(2) = 0
Proof:
Consider the series equivalent of ln 2:

Rearange the terms:
ln 2 = (1 + 1/3 + 1/5 + 1/7 ...) - (1/2 + 1/4 + 1/6 + 1/8 ...)
Thus:
ln 2 = (1 + 1/3 + 1/5 + 1/7 ...) + (1/2 + 1/4 + 1/6 + 1/8 ...) -
        2 * (1/2 + 1/4 + 1/6 + 1/8 ...)
Combine the first to series:
ln 2 = (1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 ...) - (1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 ...)
Therefore:
ln 2 = 0

Methods of Mathematical Proof

This is from _A Random Walk in Science_, R.L. Weber and E. Mendoza (ed.)(by
Joel E. Cohen?):


To illustrate the various methods of proof we give an example of a
logical system.

THE PEJORATIVE CALCULUS

Lemma 1.  All horses are the same colour.
          (Proof by induction)

Proof.  It is obvious that one horse is the same colour.  Let us assume
the proposition P(k) that k horses are the same colour and use this to
imply that k+1 horses are the same colour.  Given the set of k+1 horses,
we remove one horse; then the remaining k horses are the same colour,
by hypothesis.  We remove another horse and replace the first; the k
horses, by hypothesis, are again the same colour.  We repeat this until
by exhaustion the k+1 sets of k horses have been shown to be the same
colour.  It follows that since every horse is the same colour as every
other horse, P(k) entails P(k+1).  But since we have shown P(1) to be
true, P is true for all succeeding values of k, that is, all horses are
the same colour.

Theorem 1.  Every horse has an infinite number of legs.
            (Proof by intimidation.)

Proof.  Horses have an even number of legs.  Behind they have two legs
and in front they have fore legs.  This makes six legs, which is cer-
tainly an odd number of legs for a horse.  But the only number that is
both odd and even is infinity.  Therefore horses have an infinite num-
ber of legs.  Now to show that this is general, suppose that somewhere
there is a horse with a finite number of legs.  But that is a horse of
another colour, and by the lemma that does not exist.

Corollary 1.  Everything is the same colour.

Proof.  The proof of lemma 1 does not depend at all on the nature of the
object under consideration.  The predicate of the antecedent of the uni-
versally-quantified conditional 'For all x, if x is a horse, then x is
the same colour,' namely 'is a horse' may be generalized to 'is anything'
without affecting the validity of the proof; hence, 'for all x, if x is
anything, x is the same colour.'

Corollary 2.  Everything is white.

Proof.  If a sentential formula in x is logically true, then any parti-
cular substitution instance of it is a true sentence.  In particular
then:  'for all x, if x is an elephant, then x is the same colour' is
true.  Now it is manifestly axiomatic that white elephants exist (for
proof by blatant assertion consult Mark Twain 'The Stolen White Ele-
phant').  Therefore all elephants are white.  By corollary 1 everything
is white.

Theorem 2.  Alexander the Great did not exist and he had an infinite
number of limbs.

Proof.  We prove this theorem in two parts.  First we note the obvious
fact that historians always tell the truth (for historians always take
a stand, and therefore they cannot lie).  Hence we have the historically
true sentence, 'If Alexander the Great existed, then he rode a black
horse Bucephalus.'  But we know by corollary 2 everything is white;
hence Alexander could not have ridden a black horse.  Since the conse-
quent of the conditional is false, in order for the whole statement to
be true the antecedent must be false.  Hence Alexander the Great did not
exist.
  We have also the historically true statement that Alexander was warned
by an oracle that he would meet death if he crossed a certain river.  He
had two legs; and 'forewarned is four-armed.'  This gives him six limbs,
an even number, which is certainly an odd number of limbs for a man.
Now the only number which is even and odd is infinity; hence Alexander
had an infinite number of limbs.  We have thus proved that Alexander the
Great did not exist and that he had an infinite number of limbs.

Prove that the crocodile is longer than it is wide.

Lemma 1. The crocodile is longer than it is green:
Let's look at the crocodile. It is long on the top and on the bottom, but
it is green only on the top. Therefore, the crocodile is longer than it is
green.

Lemma 2. The crocodile is greener than it is wide:
Let's look at the crocodile. It is green along its length and width, but it
is wide only along its width. Therefore, the crocodile is greener than it
is wide.

From Lemma 1 and Lemma 2 we conclude that the crocodile is longer than it
is wide.

Proof: Girls are evil:

First we state that girls require time and money :-

 Girls = Time x Money

And we know that time is money :-

 Time = Money

Therefore :-

 Girls = Money x Money

 Girls = (Money)^2

And because 'money is the root of all evil'

 Girls = (Evil)^1/2 x (Evil)^1/2
 Girls = Evil

From: geenius@enteract.com (Geenius@Wrok)

Note:
A problem with this proof occurred to me immediately: Since evil is
negative, the square root of evil must be imaginary, which would mean that
money is imaginary, and therefore, by definition, so is time.

Then I realized that, in my life at least, that's pretty much true.

Proof: Girls are good:

First we state that girls require time and money :-

And we know that time is money :-

 Time = Money

Therefore :-

 Girls = Money x Money

 Girls = (Money)^2

And because 'money is the root of all evil'

 Girls = (Evil)^1/2 x (Evil)^1/2

But evil is negative, and hence
(Evil)^1/2=i(|Evil|)^1/2

Multiplying the two imaginaries gives -Evil,

 which is of course GOOD!

M___________________________________________________________________________
From: Raymond Kristiansen <raymond@spam.no>
Proof: Girls are the root of all evil.
if girls require time _and_ money, should that be stated

 Girls = Time + Money

instead? This leaves us with, using the well-known fact that time is
money which you mentioned,

Girls = 2*Money

Under the assumption that money is the root of all evil, it can now be
found that

Girls = 2*sqrt(evil)

In words, girls are _twice_ the root of all evil, instead of just evil,
as you proved.

From: "Anthony Coulter" <c17gmaster@earthlink.net>
There have been some disputes over the initial equation. I would like to
solve these. The correct equation is:

            G = tm   | where G = Girls, t = time, and m = money

    Girls are equal to time and money. Note that it is not negative time or
money. Think of it this way: You can either have the girl, or you can have
free time and money. They are equivalent.

    Also note that time AND money is time multiplied by money. The Boolean
operator "AND" is best represented by multiplication, while "OR" is
represented by addition. Thus, girls equal "tm" and not "t+m".

    After this point, the theorem is straightforward. Time equals money,
and money is the square root of all evil, thus girls equal evil.

    I hope I helped to clear up any misunderstandings on the matter.

Theorem: The less you know the more money you make.

Proof:
We know that
a) Time is Money
b) Knowledge is Power
and from Physics
c) Power = Work / Time

By simple substitution:
Knowledge = Work / Money
Knowledge * Money = Work
Money = Work / Knowledge

It follows that as knowledge goes to 0, money goes to infinity.

This was posted to sci.math , by James Patrick Ferry, a few days ago; in
case you didn't noticed it :-)


Those of you who have been working on a proof of Fermat's Last
Theorem, you may cease your labors.  I have produced a proof
whose simplicity cannot be surpassed.

      ---------------------------------------------------------
Statement:  For any integer n >= 3, there do not exist non-zero
integers x, y and z such that x^n + y^n = z^n.

Proof:
      ---------------------------------------------------------

That's right!  My proof is . . . the null proof!  This proof
has many advantages over the proofs offered by others:

1)  When one correctly appreciates Fermat's sense of humor, one
    sees that this is the proof he had in mind.  The margin too
    small?  Hah!  It was in the margin the whole time, but
    mathematicians, not being able to free themselves of their
    entrenched notions of "proof," were simply unable to see it.

2)  It is concise.

3)  It is my one and only, first and final version.

4)  There are no gaping holes of reasoning.

5)  There are no bizarre, non-mathematical definitions.

Jealous mathematicians have naturally questioned my proof.  But
none of their counter-arguments pass muster:

> That's not a proof.  That's just stupid.

That's not a counter-argument.  That's just histrionics.  Until
someone either produces a counter-example or points out the
*specific* place in my proof where it fails, I shall consider
my proof valid.  Your emotionalism is no substitute for logic.

> Umm, what makes this a proof of FLT rather than, well, any

What makes *any* proof a proof of what it proves rather than of
something else?  The fact that it proves it.  Duh.

> just silly.  It is hard even to talk about.  A proof has to

A lump of tuna?  Again, histrionics.  Again, a mathematician
who insists it isn't fair unless you play by his rules.  Have
you produced a counter-example?  Have you found a *specific*
place in my proof where it fails?  Then shut up.

It's bad enough that close-minded mathematical community won't
recognize my brilliance.  But to heap insult and abuse on top of
that . . . well, I shouldn't be surprised.  It's the same old
story:  the noble and intelligent hounded by the vicious and
ignorant.  Sigh.  Again I say, sigh.

Theorem: All odd numbers are prime
Proof:
Here is a set-theoretical proof of this assertion :

1) it is well known that there is an infinite number of odd primes
2) Test each and every prime in any order
3) If you encounter a number you can prove being prime (which can be
done in a finite amount of time, assuming it is), put it into set # 1
4) If you encounter a number you cannot prove being prime, put it into
set # 2
5) now read all odd numbers, beginning with set #1. You won't be able to
get to the numbers of set #2 in a finite amount of time, so you will
encounter only prime numbers.

Since no non-prime odd number will be found, the assertions "there
exists a non-prime odd" cant't be proved.

End of the proof.

... Wait a minut. What if, in step #5, we read the first item in 1
second time, then the second in 1/2 second time, and so on ? Oops ...

Two statisticians were travelling in an airplane from LA to New York.
About an hour into the flight, the pilot announced that they had lost an
engine, but don't worry, there are three left. However, instead of 5 hours
it would take 7 hours to get to New York. A little later, he announced that
a second engine failed, and they still had two left, but it would take 10
hours to get to New York. Somewhat later, the pilot again came on the
intercom and announced that a third engine had died.  Never fear, he
announced, because the plane could fly on a single engine.  However, it
would now take 18 hours to get to new York. At this point, one statistician
turned to the other and said, "Gee, I hope we don't lose that last engine,
or we'll be up here forever!"

So much? Then it surely will be mine!" "Well, there is an easy way
out. Simply take the next plane. It's much more probable that you go from a
crashing to a non-crashing plane than the other way round. So you are
already at 1:10000 squared."

          The Top Ten Reasons why statisticians are misunderstood

1: They speak only the Greek language.

2: They usually have long threatening names such as Bonferonni,
   Tchebycheff, Schatzoff, Hotelling, and Godambe. Where are the
   statisticians with names such as Smith, Brown, or Johnson?

3: They are fond of all snakes and typically own as a pet a large South
   American snake called an ANOCOVA.

4: For perverse reasons, rather than view a matrix right side up they
   prefer to invert it.

5: Rather than moonlighting by holding Amway parties they earn a few extra
   bucks by holding pocket-protector parties.

6: They are frequently seen in their back yards on clear nights gazing
   through powerful amateur telescopes looking for distant star
   constellations called ANOVA's.

7: They are 99% confident that sleep can not be induced in an introductory
   statistics class by lecturing on z-scores.

8: Their idea of a scenic and exotic trip is traveling three standard
   deviations above the mean in a normal distribution.

9: They manifest many psychological disorders because as young
   statisticians many of their statistical hypotheses were rejected.

10:They express a deap-seated fear that society will someday construct
   tests that will enable everyone to make the same score. Without
   variation or individual differences the field of statistics has no
   real function and a statistician becomes a penniless ward of the
   state.

From: Mathematics Magazine, December 1990.
Subject: Statisticians

( Excerpted from "Quotes, Damned Quotes" by John Bibby )

If there is a 50-50 chance that something can go wrong, then 9
times out of ten it will. (Paul Harvey News, 1979)

``Give us a copper Guv'' said the beggar to the Treasury
statistician, when he waylaid him in Parliament square. ``I
haven't eaten for three days.'' ``Ah,'' said the statistician, ``and
how does that compare with the same period last year?'' (Russell
Lewis)

``I gather, young man, that you wish to be a Member of
Parliament. The first lesson that you must learn is, when I call
for statistics about the rate of infant mortality, what I want
is proof that fewer babies died when I was Prime Minister than
when anyone else was Prime Minister. That is a political
statistic.'' (Winston Churchill)

``You haven't told me yet,'' said Lady Nuttal, ``what it is your
fiance does for a living.''
``He's a statistician,'' replied Lamia, with an annoying sense of
being on the defensive.
Lady Nuttal was obviously taken aback. It had not occurred to
her that statisticians entered into normal social relationships.
The species, she would have surmised, was perpetuated in some
collateral manner, like mules.
``But Aunt Sara, it's a very interesting profession,'' said Lamia
warmly.
``I don't doubt it,'' said her aunt, who obviously doubted it very
much. ``To express anything important in mere figures is so
plainly impossible that there must be endless scope for
well-paid advice on the how to do it. But don't you think that
life with a statistician would be rather, shall we say,
humdrum?''
Lamia was silent. She felt reluctant to discuss the surprising
depth of emotional possibility which she had discovered below
Edward's numerical veneer.
``It's not the figures themselves,'' she said finally. ``It's what
you do with them that matters.'' (K.A.C. Manderville, The undoing
of Lamia Gurdleneck)
M__________________________________________________________________________
People who do very unusual jobs: the man who counts then number of people
at public gatherings.

You've probably seen his headlines, "Two million flock to see Pope.", "200
arrested as police find ounce of cannabis.", "Britain #3 billion in debt".
You probably wondered who was responsible for producing such well
rounded-up figures. What you didn't know was that it was all the work of
one man, Rounder-Up to the media, John Wheeler. But how is he able to go
on turning out such spot-on statistics? How can he be so accurate all the
time?

"We can't" admits Wheeler blithely. "Frankly, after the first million we
stop counting, and round it up to the next million. I don't know if you've
ever counted a papal flock, but, not only do they look a bit the same,
they also don't keep still, what with all the bowing and crossing
themselves."

"The only way you could do it accurately is by taking an aerial photograph
of the crowd and handing it to the computer to work out. But then you'd
get a headline saying "1,678,163 [sic] flock to see Pope, not including
35,467 who couldn't see him", and, believe me, nobody wants that sort of
headline."

The art of big figures, avers Wheeler, lies in psychology, not statistics.
The public like a figure it can admire. It likes millionaires, and
million-sellers, and centuries at cricket, so Wheeler's international
agency gives them the figures it wants, which involves not only rounding
up but rounding down.

"In the old days people used to deal with crowds on the Isle of Wight
principle -- you know, they'd say that every day the population of the
world increased by the number of people who could stand upright on the
Isle of Wight, or the rain-forests were being decreased by an area the
size of Rutland. This meant nothing. Most people had never been to the
Isle of Wight for a start, and even if they had, they only had a vision of
lots of Chinese standing in the grounds of the Cowes Yacht Club. And the
Rutland comparison was so useless that they were driven to abolish Rutland
to get rid of it.

"No, what people want is a few good millions. A hundred million, if
possible. One of our inventions was street value, for instance. In the old
days they used to say that police had discovered drugs in a quantity large
enough to get all of Rutland stoned for a fortnight. *We* started saying
that the drugs had a street value of #10 million. Absolutely meaningless,
but people understand it better."

Sometimes they do get the figures spot on. "250,000 flock to see Royal
two", was one of his recent headlines, and although the 250,000 was a
rounded-up figure, the two was quite correct. in his palatial office he
sits surrounded by relics of past headlines - a million-year-old fossil, a
#500,000 Manet, a photograph of the Sultan of Brunei's #10,000,000 house -
but pride of place goes to a pair of shoes framed on the wall.

"Why the shoes? Because they cost me #39.99. They serve as a reminder of
mankind's other great urge, to have stupid odd figures. Strange, isn't it?
They want mass demos of exactly half a million, but they also want their
gramophone records to go round at thirty-three-and-a-third, forty-five and
seventy-eight rpm. We have stayed in business by remembering that below a
certain level people want oddity. They don't a rocket costing #299 million
and 99p, and they don't want a radio costing exactly #50."

How does he explain the times when the figures clash - when, for example,
the organisers of a demo claim 250,000 but the police put it nearer
100,000?

"We provide both sets of figures; the figures the organisers want, and the
figures the police want. The public believe both. If we gave the true
figure, about 167,890, nobody would believe it because it doesn't sound
believable."

John Wheeler's name has never become well-known, as he is a shy figure,
but his firm has an annual turnover of #3 million and his eye for the
right figure has made him a rich man. His greatest pleasure, however,
comes from the people he meets in the counting game.

"Exactly two billion, to be precise."

coin...writing the answer.  At the end of the two hours, everyone else
had left the final except for the one student.  The professor walks up to

"Listen, I have seen that you did not study for this statistics test, you

One day a colleague met him at a conference far from home.  "How did you get
here, by train?"

"No, I flew"

"What about your the possibiltiy of a bomb?"

Well, I began thinking that if the odds of one bomb are 1:million, then the
odds of TWO bombs are (1/1,000,000) x (1/1,000,000).  This is a very, very
small probability, which I can accept.  So, now I bring my own bomb along!"

A shoeseller meets a mathematician and complains that he does not know what
size shoes to buy.  "No problem," says the mathematician, "there is a simple
equation for that," and he shows him the Gaussian normal distribution.  The
shoeseller stares some time at het equation and asks, "What is that symbol?"
"That is the Greek letter pi."  "What is pi?" "That is the ratio between the
circumference and the diameter of a circle."  Upon this the shoeseller cries
out: "What does a circle have to do with shoes?!"

A certain well-known pure mathematician had a wife who, while
intelligent, was not into mathematics. However, by continued
practice, she learnt to distinguish between the conversations
of algebraists and analysts. So when he had guests to dinner
who were talking about mathematics, if they were analysts, she
would introduce at a suitable pause in the conversation:
        "But what happens at the boundary?"
Whereas, if they were algebraists, she would say:
        "But do the roots lie in the field?"
By this means she was always able to impress his visitors by
her knowledge of mathematics.

A small, 14-seat plane is circling for a landing in Atlanta.  It's
totally fogged in, zero visibility, and suddenly there's a small
electrical fire in the cockpit which disables all of the instruments
and the radio.  The pilot continues circling, totally lost, when
suddenly he finds himself flying next to a tall office building.

He rolls down the window (this particular airplane happens to have
roll-down windows) and yells to a person inside the building, "Where
are we?"

The person responds "In an airplane!"

The pilot then banks sharply to the right, circles twice, and makes a
perfect landing at Atlanta International.

As the passengers emerge, shaken but unhurt, one of them says to the
pilot, "I'm certainly glad you were able to land safely, but I don't
understand how the response you got was any use."

"Simple," responded the pilot.  "I got an answer that was completely
accurate and totally irrelevant to my problem, so I knew it had to be

From: rrcraig@eos.ncsu.edu (Ralph Ray Craig)

Q:  How many numerical analysts does it take to screw in a light bulb?
A:  0.9973 after the first three iterations.

Q:  How many topologists does it take to change a light bulb?
A:  It really doesn't matter, since they'd rather knot.
From:BRIAN6@VAXC.MDX.AC.UK (canonical lightbulb collection)

Q:  How many mathematicians does it take to screw in a lightbulb?
A:  None.  It's left to the reader as an exercise.
A:  Just one, once you've managed to present the problem in terms he/she
    is familiar with.

    In earlier work, Wiener [1] has shown that one mathematician
    can change a light bulb.

    If k mathematicians can change a light bulb, and if one more simply
    watches them do it, then k+1 mathematicians will have changed the
    light bulb.

    Therefore, by induction, for all n in the positive integers,
    n mathematicians can change a light bulb.

    [1] Wiener, Matthew P., <11485@ucbvax>, "Re: YALBJ", 1986

Q:  How many statisticians does it take to change a lightbulb ?
A:  This should be determined using a nonparametric procedure, since
    statisticians are NOT NORMAL.
A:  Walt Pirie to hold the bulb and one psychologist, one economist,
    one sociologist and one anthropologist to pull away the ladder.
A:  One -- plus or minus three (small sample size).
(Notes: Someone has been asking this as a bonus question on statistics exam
papers for quite a while. Judging from some of his own students' exam
answers, it depends on whether the lightbulb is negatively or positively
screwed.)

Q:  How many light bulbs does it take to change a light bulb?
A:  One, if it knows its own Goedel number.
(Has to do with Goedel's incompleteness theorem)

From: feldco@aol.com (Zevra and his little green guy)

How many mathematicians does it take to change a light bulb?
 None. The answer is intuitively obvious.

How many mathematical logicians does it take to change a light bulb?
 None. They can't do it, but they can easily prove that it can be done.

How many classical geometers does it take to change a light bulb?
 None. You can't do it with a straight edge and a compass.

How many analysts does it take to change a light bulb?
 Three. One to prove existence, one to prove uniqueness and one to derive a
nonconstructive algorithm to do it.

How many number theorists does it take to change a light bulb?
 I don't know the exact number, but I am sure it must be some rather elegant
prime.

What is the difference between an applied mathematician and a pure
mathematician?

Suppose a mathematician parks his car, locks it with his key and walks
away. After walking about 50 yards the mathematician realizes that he has
dropped his key somewhere along the way. What does he do? If he is an
applied mathematician he walks back to the car along the path he has
previously traveled looking for his key. If he is a pure mathematician he
walks to the other end of the parking lot where there is better light
and looks for his key there.

I told this joke to my brother (he is a "pure"). He answers:
"But we have not dropped our keys!" Hence, I suggest a slight
modification:

Suppose a _tax_payer_ parks his car, locks it with his key and walks
away. After walking about 50 yards the tax payer realizes that he
has dropped his key somewhere along the way. He asked a mathematician
to help him. What does the mathematician do? (...)

The famous professor of mathematics was in town for a conference.
Since he had some free time, he was approached to give a seminar for
the undergraduate mathematics students at the local college.

After covering several blackboards with densely packed computations
and expressions filled with Bessel functions and more, the professor
remembered that there were many undergraduate students in the room.
Feeling just a twinge of remorse that perhaps he was talking above
the heads of some of the students in his audience, he turned around
and asked the audience if there were any students who had never seen
a Bessel function. The audience was silent for a moment. Finally, one
intrepid student raised his hand to admit that he had never seen Bessel
functions. The professor nodded with apparent comprehension. Without
hesitation, he turned around and pointed at the blackboard, while saying
"well, there's one now" and continued his talk.

Just to throw in my two cents worth in to the Intuitively Obvious
bucket, when I was a math student at Towson State University we were
given a final exam that involved proving that two N dimensional
matrices were related in a given way.  I started with the first matrix
and used every theorem that I could remember trying to reach the
second, but I got stuck halfway through.  Working feverishly on a
piece of scrap paper, I started on the second matrix, but couldn't
work it back to the first.  In a flash of inspiration, I set the two
intermediate results equal to each other and copied the second set of
equations backwards onto the tail of the first.  When I got the paper
back, there was a C which was crossed out and replaced by an A, the
midpoint of my equations was underlined, with a note saying - At first
I doubted that this step was intuitively obvious, but after thinking
about it for several hours, I decided that it was.

All right, you asked for it.  A (possibly apocryphal) story related to
me by a graduate student who had come from a large midwest
(Wisconsin?) univ.  Seems that one of his classes was taught by the
department emeritus Prof who was very old (in his 80's) and sometimes
a bit vague, but at other times incredibly sharp.  One day in lecture
he was explaining something abstruse and paused to look at the board
for a moment.  Thereupon he wrote down a result and said, eyes
twinkling, "And this is intuitively obvious..".  Whereupon he smiled,
looked out over the class, saw the rows of blank stares, and turned
back to the board to contemplate the statement written there.  This
went on for about a minute, at the end of which time he started to
wander, rather deeply in thought, across the stage.  This went on for
a minute or two, after which the Prof. drifted out into the hall and
was heard walking back and forth.  People started to, well, look at
each other and smile.  A scout was sent out who reported the old boy
was pacing around and muttering to himself.  The class, incredibly,
remained reasonably calm.

About five minutes after the scout had returned, there was a happy
shout from the hallway, and the again bright-eyed Prof. scuttled back
in, pointed to the intuitively obvious result written on the
blackboard, turned to the class and said, all aglow,
	"Yes, yes, it IS intuitively obvious".

Same source, different Prof.  This one happened to not like students
coming in late to the math class he taught..so much so that he would
do any of the following to the offender: lock them out, yell at them
abusively, throw chalk at them. One day, the Prof. was late.  Five
minutes went by.  Silently, one of the students went down and started
passing up to the audience all the chalk pieces and erasers.  The
Prof. came rushing in at last, gave no excuse, and began to lecture.
After about a minute, he needed the chalk, and asked "Has anyone seen
the chalk?".  The entire class stood up and bombarded him with chalk
and erasers.  The professor was said never to have abused a student
for lateness again.....

This actually happened about 15 years ago, when -- as a young lecturer -- I
was asked to give a course on Foundations of Analysis.  I was sure at the
time that the students already know the subject matter and they will be
wasting their time listening to me.  I was quite surprised, when I entered
the classroom for the first lecture, to find a room packed with students.
I was going to suggest that those who know the subject matter leave the
course, so as not to waste time and energy.  I therefore asked the
following question: "Has any one of you, by chance, read the book of
Landau: Foundations of Analysis?"

The class suddenly became very quiet, until a student from the last
row said: "I did not read the book, but I saw the movie."

Weeks later we were laughing, trying to imagine to ourselves how a
movie on Foundation of Analysis could look like.

A "small college story" going around here (at least three people have
told me this story, each one claiming it was them):

A student, working on a rather long math homework assignment,
discovered that one problem was fairly easy to solve, except that it
required about three pages of fairly simple proof after the one or two
difficult steps.  It being rather late at night, he did the difficult
steps and left the proof undone, along with a note:

"This proof is left as an exercise for the grader."

Next week, he received his homework back.  He noted that several extra
pages had been stapled to the back of it.  Examining the extra pages,
he was surprised to find the entire proof written down step-by step.
At the end, in red pen, the grader had written:

"I made a minor math error.  Minus 2."

While taking a psych. course in college, the teacher had a habit of
putting the following questions on an exam:

"Ask yourself a question and answer it"

Being a math major, I asked myself "Solve the following differential
equation [* equation deleted *] under the following conditions
[* conditions deleted *]"

and proceeded to solve it.

The next day I stopped by the math office to see one of the profs.  He
told me "Go away, I'm stuck grading your stupid psych. exam".

I got full credit, and the psych prof. never put that question on an
exam again.

Well, I've got a favorite story from my Math-Phys course in undergrad.
I figure the statute of limitations on the marks has expired now, so
here goes.

The typical problem, show <expr> is equal to <much simpler expr>.  The
math was pretty nasty, and half-way through it looked like I'd need a
clue to getting to the answer, so I went to the result and tried to
work it back to the intermediate result (typical test/homework trick).
They didn't meet.  I had two expressions which I knew were equal from
plugging into the calculator, but I couldn't show it algebraically.
So, I used another familiar trick, between the two lines I wrote: ICBS
(it can be shown) and stuck it between the two pieces I couldn't
connect.

Now, somebody else in the class did the same thing, exactly, and got
stuck in exactly the same place.  He wrote: TAMO (then a miracle
occurs) in the same place.

I got full marks, he lost marks and got a sarcastic comment from the
corrector.

A mathematician was in a habit of making a cup of tea when working late at
night. His normal method was to get the teapot from the cupboard, take the
teapot to the sink, add water, heat to boiling, then make the cup of tea.
Unfortunately, one night when he went to make tea, the teapot was already
full of water and sitting on the stove. He thought about this for several
minutes, then emptied the teapot and put it back in the cupboard, thereby
reducing this to a previously solved problem.

And you give it a circle-shaped tear,

Of a runner who wasn't too bright
    But he sprinted so fast,
    That he vanished at last
By red-shifting himself out of sight.

Locate some points with girth so ample,

Remember school math(s)? Remember quadratic equations?
Right!   Read:- 'a2' below as "a squared"
                'b2' below as "b squared" etc.

If a = b (so I say)                     [a = b]
And we multiply both sides by a
     Then we'll see that a2             [a2 = ab]
     When with ab compared
Are the same. Remove b2. OK?            [a2-b2 = ab-b2]

Both sides we will factorize. See?
Now each side contains a - b.           [(a+b)(a-b) = b(a-b)]
     We'll divide through by a
     Minus b and olé
a + b = b. Oh whoopee!                  [a+b = b]

But since I said a = b
b + b = b you'll agree?                 [b+b = b]
     So if b = 1
     Then this sum I have done          [1+1 = 1]
Proves that 2 = 1. Q.E.D.

Hiawatha Designs an Experiment

Hiawatha, mighty hunter,
He could shoot ten arrows upward,
Shoot them with such strength and swiftness
That the last had left the bow-string
Ere the first to earth descended.

This was commonly regarded
As a feat of skill and cunning.
Several sarcastic spirits
Pointed out to him, however,
That it might be much more useful
If he sometimes hit the target.
"Why not shoot a little straighter
And employ a smaller sample?"
Hiawatha, who at college
Majored in applied statistics,
Consequently felt entitled
To instruct his fellow man
In any subject whatsoever,
Waxed exceedingly indignant,
Talked about the law of errors,
Talked about truncated normals,
Talked of loss of information,
Talked about his lack of bias,
Pointed out that (in the long run)
Independent observations,
Even though they missed the target,
Had an average point of impact
Very near the spot he aimed at,
With the possible exception
of a set of measure zero.

"This," they said, "was rather doubtful;
Anyway it didn't matter.
What resulted in the long run:
Either he must hit the target
Much more often than at present,
Or himself would have to pay for
All the arrows he had wasted."

Hiawatha, in a temper,
Quoted parts of R. A. Fisher,
Quoted Yates and quoted Finney,
Quoted reams of Oscar Kempthorne,
Quoted Anderson and Bancroft
(practically in extenso)
Trying to impress upon them
That what actually mattered
Was to estimate the error.

Several of them admitted:
"Such a thing might have its uses;
Still," they said, "he would do better
If he shot a little straighter."

Hiawatha, to convince them,
Organized a shooting contest.
Laid out in the proper manner
Of designs experimental
Recommended in the textbooks,
Mainly used for tasting tea
(but sometimes used in other cases)
Used factorial arrangements
And the theory of Galois,
Got a nicely balanced layout
And successfully confounded
Second order interactions.

All the other tribal marksmen,
Ignorant benighted creatures
Of experimental setups,
Used their time of preparation
Putting in a lot of practice
Merely shooting at the target.

Thus it happened in the contest
That their scores were most impressive
With one solitary exception.
This, I hate to have to say it,
Was the score of Hiawatha,
Who as usual shot his arrows,
Shot them with great strength and swiftness,
Managing to be unbiased,
Not however with a salvo
Managing to hit the target.

"There!" they said to Hiawatha,
"That is what we all expected."
Hiawatha, nothing daunted,
Called for pen and called for paper.
But analysis of variance
Finally produced the figures
Showing beyond all peradventure,
Everybody else was biased.
And the variance components
Did not differ from each other's,
Or from Hiawatha's.
(This last point it might be mentioned,
Would have been much more convincing
If he hadn't been compelled to
Estimate his own components
From experimental plots on
Which the values all were missing.)

Still they couldn't understand it,
So they couldn't raise objections.
(Which is what so often happens
with analysis of variance.)
All the same his fellow tribesmen,
Ignorant benighted heathens,
Took away his bow and arrows,
Said that though my Hiawatha
Was a brilliant statistician,
He was useless as a bowman.
As for variance components
Several of the more outspoken
Make primeval observations
Hurtful of the finer feelings
Even of the statistician.

In a corner of the forest
Sits alone my Hiawatha
Permanently cogitating
On the normal law of errors.
Wondering in idle moments
If perhaps increased precision
Might perhaps be sometimes better
Even at the cost of bias,
If one could thereby now and then
Register upon a target.

          FOUNDATIONS OF ARITHMETIC
                        By J.A. Lindon

One day when Mugg the Missing Link was prowling through the woods,
In search of wives and mammoth-meat and other usefull goods,
Whom should he see, on pushing out from deep arboreal shade,
But Ogg, the Paleolithic Man, cross-legged in a glade.

This Ogg had made a neat array of pebbles on the ground,
In number they were twenty-one, the most that could be found,
And Ogg, with one red-hairy hand pressed to his bony brow,
Was staring at hese pebbles like a ruminating cow.

           o o o o o o o
           o o o o o o o
           o o o o o o o

Thought Mugg - for he was Primitive - I should be very dull
To lose this opportunity of busting in his skull;
My club weighs half a hundredweigh, he doesn't wear a hat
(And here he wondered) Yes, but what the devil is he at?

For Ogg was touching pebbles and then prodding at his digits,
Until the weirdness of it all afflicted Mugg with fidgets:
"Invented any goodish wheels just recently?" he hollered,
And doubled up in merriments, his face raw-beefy coloured.

Ogg looked at him in pity, then he drummed upon his chest:
"I've don a Think!" he bellowed "Monkey Mugg. I've done a think!
And I would write it down, but no one's yet invented ink."

Mugg moved a little closer, and his eyes and mouth were round,
And stared in trepidation at those pebbles on the ground.
Ogg pointed with a nailed red-hairy sausage at the rows
And said, "Three people's hand-plus-two is hand-plus-feet-plus-nose."

oooo       oooo       oooo       oooo     oooo
     o   +      o   +      o   =      o o       + ooooO Oooo + A
 o          o          o
 o          o          o


"And this is hand-plus-two of people's three-for-each-by-name,
So three times hand-plus-two and hand-plus-to time three's the same!"
Mugg scratched his matted hairy head, not knowing what to say.
Said Ogg, "It's all made clear by this rectangular array."



                             o o o
                             o o o
           o o o o o o o     o o o
           o o o o o o o  =  o o o
           o o o o o o o     o o o
                             o o o
                             o o o

"Three rows of hand-plus-two and hand-plus-two short rows of three
are just the same according to which way you look, you see?
In brief, a tripe heptad is the same as seven trebles,
And may quite possibly be true of other things than pebbles."

Mugg viewed it from all angles, then he gave a raucous belch
And trod on a Batrachian that perished with a sqelch.
He growled, "I do not understand these arithmetic quirks,
But maybe we should try to discover if it works."

So home they went to get their wives and drag them by the hair,
For Mugg had feet-plus-hand-plus-four, while Ogg had just a pair;
But what with all their screeching and their running every way,
At first they would not form a neat rectangular array.

So Ogg he then positioned each by holding of her down
While Mugg with mighty club in hand, just dinted in her crown;
And when they had them all in place, like pebbles, they could see
That three times hand-plus-two in wives was hand-plus-two times three!

      o<= o<= =>o =>o o<= o<= =>o

      =>o o<= o<= =>o o<= o<= =>o

      o<= =>o =>o o<= =>o o<= =>o

Then Ogg he roared in high delight, cartwheeling to and fro
(Carts had not been invented, but he did it just to show!),
And Mugg he grinned a shaggy grin and slapped a hairy thigh
And said, "It's true, as sure as Pterodactyls learned to fly!"

And then they feasted on their wives in unuxorious zest,
Exept for one whose skull was rather thicker than the rest,
And she was sent to dig a pit and bury every bone,
While Mugg and Ogg went off to find a flat unsullied stone.

Then Ogg he sharpened up a flint and scratched upon the rock:
First Arithmetic Theorem - by Ogg the son of Mok.
He drew his little diagram, and proved, with QED,
That three times hand-plus-two of x is hand-plus-two times three.

But Mugg the Missing Link grew bored, and left him there alone,
Still scratching with his silly flint upon his silly stone;
And belching, plunged back in the woods on feet toe's simple fives,
In search of wives and mammoth-meat, particularly wives!

Practical Application:

He's teaching her arithmetic,
He said it was his mission,
He kissed her once, he kissed her twice
 and said, "Now that's addition."

As he added smack by smack
In silent satisfaction,
She sweetly gave the kisses back
 and said, "Now that's subtraction."

Then he kissed her, she kissed him,
Without an explanation,
And both together smiled and said,
"That's multiplication."

Then Dad appeared upon the scene and
Made a quick decision.
He kicked that kid three blocks away
And said, "That's long division!"

       THE KISS PRECISE

For pairs of lips to kiss maybe
Involves no trigonometry.
'T is not so when for circles kiss
Each one the other three.
To bring this off the four must be:
As three in one or one in three.
If one in three, beyond a doubt
Each gets three kisses from without.
If three in one, then is that one
Thrice kissed internally.

Four circles to the kissing come.
The smaller are the benter.
The bend is just the inverse of
The distance form the center.
Though their intrigue left Euclid dumb
There's now no need for rule of thumb.
Since zero's bend's a dead straight line
And concave bends have minus sign,
The sum of the squares of all four bends
Is half the square of their sum.

To spy out spherical affairs
An oscular surveyor
Might find the task laborious,
And now besides the pair of pairs
A fifth spere in the kissing shares.
Yet, signs and zero as before,
For each to kiss the other four
The quare of the sum of all five bends
Is thrice the sum of their squares.
                                       - Frederick Soddy

And let us not confine our cares
To simple circles, planes and spheres,
But rise to hyper flats and bends
Where kissing multiple appears.
In n-ic space the kissing pairs
Are hyperspheres, and Truth declares-
As n + 2 such osculate
Each with an n + 1-fold mate.
The square of the sum of all the bends
Is n times the sum of their squares.
                                       - Thorold Gosset

                            MATH 101 LIMERICKS
(meaning, precalc and finance math, required math course for all students
                           at some universities)

(Quadratics)
A fair maid from North Minneapolis
was an expert at drawing parabolas.
She extended their arms
and showed off their charms
and they looked positively fabulous.

(Cost Analysis)
The cost of producing is mixed.
Part of that cost will be fixed
and the rest, never-ending
on level depending
(or maybe on politics).

(Rational Functions)
Said your favorite Zada or Tante
"for an assymptote horizonta
"you need to both both
"of the leading coeff's
"whether or not you wanta."

(Exponential Functions)
The bottom is perfectly noble
but x is now upwardly mobile
so that constant, poor dear
must downsize its carweer
and it's feeling a bit claustrophob-al.

These guys are as busy as beavers.
They've got Monday morning fever.
They just grow, grow, and grow.
They're NEVER zero
and they don't remain one for long, either.

(Logarithms)
Do logs give you logarrhea?
Is a logjam drawing near?
Just use your cerdentials
and take exponentials
to make those ol' logs disappear.

(Matrix multiplication)
Just pair off each row with each column.
Take the sums of those products so solemn.
Then beat the odds
with those scalar prods
or whatever the devil you call 'em.

(Compound interest)
"Nothing succeeds like success,"
as these formulas show with finesses.
Thus again and again
A gets bigger with n
though not quite as big as you'd guess.

(Annuities)
And now here's another fine source
(to tickle your brains in this course)
of mo' and mo' dough.
It's dough a go-go.
Oh, don't you just wish it was yours?


CALC

(Product Rule)
Diff-ing x to the x is fun.
change the n to n-l
then go back to n
and use it again
in front of it all, and you're done.

There's a general rule for all this 
(in case we have a pop quiz):
n steps down two ways
for the rest of its days
and x remains right where it is.

(Calc applications)
"Than receive, 'tis better to give."
Also, "live, live, and let live."
These are words to clutch
but not as much
as "velocity equals deriv."

(General Power Rule)
Are you bored with powers of x?
What would you like to do next?
Some powers of g
will do quite nicely
but watch out for the special effects.

(Product Rule)
Don't forget, f appears twice.
g will behave likewise.
If you make like a dunce
and write them just once. . .
well, you'll get what you get for half-price?

Said a wiseguy named Georgie O-Porgie
"Let's have a Quotient Rule orgy.
"On top, to be nice
"g appears twice
"and then on the bottom one more g."

(Chair Rule)
Rinky, dinky, dinky.
g provies the link-y.
But the x and the f
are not to be left
unless you run out of ink-y.

(Curve Sketching)
There was a young man named Kareem
who explained, "For a point rel-extreme
"the tangent at a
"to rest must lay
"and I wish it the pleasantest dream."

(integrating Powers of x)
There's general rule for all this
(and it's something you don't want to miss):
n moves up and down
without making a sound
and x stays right where it is.

(Integrating Exponentials)
And now here's a grave admonition
delivered with proper precision:
It's about that ol' k.
k steps down ONE way
and the x doesn't go where it isn't.

Minus one is a special case
delicious and dainty as lace.
So don't play the hero.
Don't divide by zero.
If you do, be sure to erase.

(Curve sketching)
We can plot and plot til we plotz.
But we've got to plot the right spots.
Or those lows and highs
could elude us like flies.
Likewise the flips and the flops.

A fair maid from North Minnesota
was drawing a steep assymptot-a.
when it got 'way too high
she murmured bye-bye
and mourned not a single iota.

("Parts")
"We need f and g-prime," said Mitch
"and it matters which is which."
"But not to worry,"
said his cousin Jerry.
"It doesn't work out, we'll switch."

Root-a-toot toot-a-falutin'.
It's time for some substitutin'.
Take the stuff on display
and collapse it away
right along with Leibnitz and Newton.

(Area between curves)
don't forget, those curves might cross
in which case you should take time to pause
so you don't subtract
when add's where it's at.
"twould be a lamentable loss.

(Solids of revolution)
a strappin' young woman named Evvie
was handed a solid of rev-vy
and asked for the volume.
She answered, quite solemn
"It's not very big but it's heavy."

(Integrations tecnniques, "sine-saving")
Said a technique freak named Zeek
"if you think sine-saving is chic
"and you want to save
"yourself into the grave
"try cos and tang and sec."

(Derivatives of trig functions)
A darling named Clementine
said "First sine, then cos, then sine
"and the minus and plus
"make things even wuss.
"Can't it make up its mind?"

(A non-limerick)
Can we integrate tan?
Yes, we can.
Can we integrate secant?
No, we can't.

(Trig-triggers -- that is, trigonometric substitutions)
A trig-trigging trickster from Beacon
is stuck on an odd-powered secant.
An integral table
would render him able
but his conscience is prodding "no peekin'."

(Improper integrals)
Said a ship-shape chap from the congo
"Since our area's infinitely long-o
"it's likely that you'd
"be inclined to conclude
"that it's infinitebig, but you're wrong-o."

(Separable Eff Eq --  Duh; what, me worry?)
A ditzo from hither or thither
refused to get all in a tither.
"'Tis true," said he, "I
"can't tell x from y
"but can't tell left from right-y, either."

COMPLEX ANALYSIS

A reality complex had Fred.
He felt kind of bad in the head.
So he took Complex Far
with Cohen Mar
got a complex complex instead.

Oh, pity the poor lonely guy.
He ex ran away with his y.
then z came along
but done him wrong.
Then his one-and-only turned i.

There was a young lady named suzie
who couldn't add 2z and 2z.
She said, "Can't it be
"without that ol' z?"
She's being a little too choosy.

(nth roots of unity)
There are n of them sprawled on a wheel.
Among them at most two are real.
The others must go
half above, half below.
But they get paired off in the dea.

e to the z is exotic
and it changes a sum to a product.
It has no root
but it's kind of cute
and it's vertically periodic.

A young man named Kenny macKenzie
had trouble computing ln z.
He breezed through the r-part
with the slickness of pop-art
but the theta-part gave him a frenzy.

Here's the key to z to the c:
It's just e to the c ln z.
But watch for ln y.
Its values are many
thought sometimes e makes them agree.

(sin and cos, revisited)
In trig and calc all through
one was the limit we knew.

after pi after n after 2
after p'renthesis ln
and then no more spellin'
unless we cah find something new.
   (Thaks to student Bob Blackard for getting me started on this one.)

The pretty professor's a rarity
her lectures the height of clarity.
Except that when
she does minus-1- to the n
n turns out to be the wrong parity.

Yes, the pretty professor, our rarity
was engulfed in hyper-hilarity
'cause again she had spun
a spare minus-one.
She said, "Well, we can give it to charity."

Here are the others.  (I guess you can tell -- every time I teach a course,
about which I haven't already written limericks, I start in.  I'm currently
writing Linear Algebra limericks; they're not perfected yet; when they are,

DIFF EQ
A starry-eyed lad from Wisconsin
was hoping those coeff's would be constant.
But his hopes turned to hexes
when he saw all those x's
so he shrugged and remarked "Stuff and nonsense."

There was a young woman named Sally.
Legendre was right up her alley.
 "Minus x square plus one
"is what starts the fun
"and n-square plus n's the finale."

Her cousin named Mary Magee
said "Bessel's much besser to me.
"x-square WITHOUT one
"seems much more fun
"and nu's cooler than n," said she.

Their cousin from Doodle=Skadiddle
said, "Yes, but what's in the middle?"
Answered they, "We suspects
"it's x or 2x.
"We're feeling a bit non-commital."

An attractive young ms. named Cassandra
was solving equations Legendre.
a-nought was do-able
a-one construable
but x-(n+2) was beyond 'er.

There was a fine fellow named ian
who was ready to give up on P-n.
He said "Too much mess
'with the n and the x."
And sometimes I can't help agreein'.

There are 5 n's, 5 2's, and 6 m's
(and be careful not to mix 'ems)
minus and factorals
in the plurals
and all those parentheses betwix 'ems.


PDE

A lad thought he'd service society
by studying math and psychiatry.
but his plans went a-ragin'
with the first wave equation
'cause he got Separation Anxiety.

(Fourier series, exponential form)
Those functions e to the in x
can be treated like cos x and sin x.
And if they can't
call me Bell Atlant-
or try MCI or Nynex.

(Fourier integral)
Are we feeling morbid and mopey
just 'cause f(x) has n p?
Don't be so limid.
Go to the limit.
When there's life, there's always hope-y.

It's Jan. 14 and our prof
by a factor of two is off.
Is she going to cry?
Says she, "Not I.
"In fact, I'm more likely to laugh."

Do you think this is getting hum-drum?
It's time to consider a drum-drum.
We'll get double series
and double theories
and B's and B*'s under 'em.

Next we make our rod very lengthy
thus increasing its impact and strenth-y.
So we've shed the L
but acquired integrell:
For thy patience I humbly thank thee.

There was a spry guy from Saigon
who was searching for values eigen-.
but the boundary conditions
surpassed all his wishin's
and wouldn't let bygones by bygone.


VECTOR ANALYSIS

Here's something to contemplate:
A vector's an arrow so straight.
For forces, its length
expresses its strength
and direction expresses its fate.

Two vectors, whatever the size
can be added, component-wize
so make so this rhymes
by adding three times
then put in the k, j, and i's.

(Scalar multiplication)
a spunky young woman named Ralpha
would multiply vectors by alpha.
She thought it quite nice
to multiply thrice
in this city of Philadal-pha.

(Scalar product)
Here's the most fun you ever had:
Take products three times and then add.
And do mind your mommas
and DON'T put in commas
(or momma will tell your Dad).

(Vector product)
In this glossy and glorious firmament
nothing's more perfect and permanent
or more fancy-free
for u criss-cross v
than our ever-lovin' determinant.

i, j, and k are cute
and they're specially fixed to compute.
E.g., i cross j
is lower-case k.
But as arrows, they're too short to shoot.

(curve parametrization)
Straight lines are quite matter-of-fact
if you know how to add and subtract.
True, there's multiplication
in this situation
but nothing on which you need act.

Although all of us are mere amateurs
in this business of making parameters
when it's circles in question 
I have a suggestion:
Try not to forget the diameters.

(formular for curvature)
r-dot dot r-dot-dot.
Yes, sometimes we dot a lot.
But dot-dot-dot?
Or r-quad-dot?
. . . well, sometimes we do not.

For that curvature fer t' compute
that formula's really a beaut.
But when figuring kappa
do mind your Pappa
and don't you forget that square root.

(Div, grad, and curl)
It's easy and fun to do grad.
It makes us feel gleesome and glad.
Don't you feel so alive
when you partial-deriv?
But put commas, now -- don't you dare add.

Here's something no one will object to:
When doing the div please expect to
take partials, three
of components of v
and be careful which with respect to.

Aloha, tres bien, and shalom?
May I mention a vital syndrome?
Towards the end of the div
you should get additive
(or just wait 'til your father gets home).

Now, the hardest is curl, we agree.
But let's have a determinant spree.
First, three vectors little
next, del in the middle
and then on the bottom goes v.

All told (and telling it true)
there's more in the curl to do.
We've got partials six
and note how they mix
and the answer's a vector, too.

(Directional derivative)
If we're out in the wide blue yon
rates of change depend, which directi-on.
So divide b by mag
then dot it with grad
and we'll find out how quickly we've gone.

(unit normals to surfaces given in the formf(x, y, z) = C )
Said a dashing young man named Aeneas
"I have a few dandy ideas.
"Just take our f's grad
"divide by the mag
"and it doesn't much matter what C is."

(Note to smart-alecks)
When these poems you so dutif-ly edit
keep one thing in mind (to my credit):
I realize that mag
does not rhyme with grad
but the point is:  YOU won't forget it.

(surface parametrization)
(plane)
If you want to be this term's winner
remember, the keyword is linear.
So let us let z be
ua + vb
(for integrals outer and inner).

(cylinder)
First, think of the x-y plane.
(That's not such a drain on the brain.)
Next, move once around
and then up and down.
If tired out, go hop on the train.

(sphere)
Said a student from South Singapore
"We use cosines and sines galore
"or the sum of three squares
"would give us nightmares --
"Yep, that's what the trig stuff is for."

(Line integrals)
And now we've got functions three.
What could the integral be?
The answer, essential:
Component, tangential.
It gets things in terms of small-t.

(surface integrals)
Next, functions (three) with a surface
(And Murphy's Law gets much more Murfish).
But the answer, informal:
Component, normal
to get u's and v's at our service.

(triple integrals)
Triple int's are very chic
so of them we now shall speak.
One thing to make clear:
No vectors here
(or you're grounded for a week).

(Divergence theorem)
Next, the surface int. above
that we've all come to know and love
will be giving way
on this fabulous day
to a triple int. of the div. of.

(Stokes)
And now it is late, not early.
'Tis time for Stokes' Theorem, surely.
Any int. (closed line)
can be redesigned
as an int. involving the curl-y.

(for those smart-alecks again)
Again, as these lim'ricks you edit
remember one thing (to my credit):
I know that designed
does not rhyme with line
but it rhymes more than how Stokes said it.


ABSTRACT ALGEBRA

We're a bunch of nincompoops.
We can't get a grip on our groups.
We ask, in a frenzy
"Z-n or nZ?"
Guess wrong, so grin and go "Ooops."

This quarter we're all pretty group-y.
It can get pretty meaty and soup-y.
Z-3 order 3
Z-p order p
and D-sub-p order 2p.

(You know how that religious mathematician Kronecker said, "God created the
   integers; the rest is the work of man."  Well -- )
"Integers are neat," said God,
"both the even and the odd.
"So I'll give you some, Kronecker
"for Christmas or Chanukah.
"(Do you mind if I package them mod?")

Said a group theory pro named McClellan
"We've got too many isom and elem
"and homom and autom
"but already bought 'em.
"Perhaps we can try to re-sell 'em."

(Automorphisms)
Some're outer, some're inner.
All're autom's (though it's winter).
Some turn out to be
the mere identity.
But that's good when you're a beginner.

Rub-a-dub, rub-a-dub bub-bub.
What, O pray tell, is this hub-hub?
It's subgroups so cool.
They obey the strict rule:
Order-wise, they divide what they're sub-ub.

In the kitchen you'll hear lots of slubbering.
In the bathroom you might see a tubring.
But the classroom, I claim
is quite tidy and tame.
All it's got is a subgroup or subring.

(More dialog between God and Kronecker)
"Integers are great," said God
"and it's fun doing sum and prod.
"But I've now got some notions
"to tackle the quotients"
and all except K. oo'd and ah'd.

"It was nice dividing by bd
"but now I'm getting more greedy."
Thus spake our Lord
standing straight at the board
writing Q bracket x and Q.E.D.

"One was good for a laugh
"and two was a treat for my staff.
'but I've now got a hankerin'
"to do some tankerin'.
"Aw c'mon, not even a half?

"For seven long days labored I
"with integers low, then high.
"But now 'tis day eight.
"'Tis time to create
"quotients and roots and pi."

Deep in waters hot, not tepid
feeling rueful but intrepid
our two creators
and integer-traitors
shrugged "Sorry, we just can't he'p it."

"Please forgive me," said Kronecker L.
"I hope you won't send me to hell.
"But x caught my attention
"and x led to extension"
and the rest we know only too well.

Yes, pity our genius and hero
who fiddled, but not like Nero.
He started with F.
Now he's got nothing left
for he sold his soul for a zero.

(Primitive element theorem)
A fair maid from Alabam-y
was given a double whammy.
But she knew how to mingle
so's to make it a single
and ace the final exam-y.

(When is F(a) isomorphic to F(x)?)
If about a we have no spec's
then a might as well be x.
And e and pi
are good a's to try
though it's not quite clear how it checks.

We might grow up to be tax-collectors
or city or country inspectors.
But Chap. 23
ensures that we
will never be angle-trisectors. 

(God confesses to Kronecker)
First I couldn't stop at 10.
Then I couldn't stop at n.
Then Z and then Q
and the square root of 2.
But I've now come to C.  Amen.

(Epilogue -- by God and Kronecker)
We work together like brothers.
One creates, the other discovers.
And Galleon writes
and Cohen recites
and we welcome any others.

underlying measures were not sets but elements of more general Boolean
algebras, and their range consisted not of positive numbers but of certain
abstract equivalence classes. My proposed first sentence was:
"The author discusses valueless measures in pointless spaces."

Kleinhenz, Robert J.
When asked what it was like to set about proving something, the
mathematician likened proving a theorem to seeing the peak of a mountain
and trying to climb to the top. One establishes a base camp and begins
scaling the mountain's sheer face, encountering obstacles at every turn,
often retracing one's steps and struggling every foot of the
journey. Finally when the top is reached, one stands examining the peak,
taking in the view of the surrounding countrysideand then noting the
automobile road up the other side!

Mathematicians my flatter themselves that they possess new ideas which mere
human language is as yet unable to express. Let them make the effort to
express these ideas in appropriate words without the aid of symbols, and if
they succeed they will not only lay us laymen under a lasting obligation,
but, we venture to say, they will find themselves very much enlightened
during the process, and will even be doubtful whether the ideas as
expressed in symbols had ever quite found their way out of the equations

This one's original.  That is to say, I made it up myself, and I've never
met anyone else who claims to have invented it.

There was once a factory that specialised in armour.  They made leather
jerkins, full plate suits, greaves, helmets, anything that would stop an
arrow or a sword.

One day, an order arrived from a foreign kingdom.  It was a big contract,
to outfit an entire army with chain-mail leggings.  The factory owner
was delighted, and immediately took the design specifications down to the
factory floor to begin production.

Several days later, a second message arrived.  Due to various
circumstances, the design of the leggings had changed.  The new
standardised national military uniform required that the hems be lowered
by several centimetres.

The factory owner grumbled about the loss of time and money involved in
changing the design, but there was nothing he could do.  He took the new
plans down to the foreman.

Several days later, another new design arrived.  The nation's uniform
requirements had changed again, and the hems must be raised, even higher
than the original design.

This went on for several weeks.  Every few days, there was a change of
plan, and the leggings had to be changed.  Sometimes the hems went up,
sometimes they went down, but every change meant a loss of money.  Finally
one day, the factory owner called the foreman up to his office, and asked
him if there was any way to stop the appalling wastage.

"Well," said the foreman "it might be that the changes are gradually
settling down, and will eventually lead to a stable set of leggings.  If
so, we could extrapolate from what we already know to find the ultimate
design, and start producing it now, knowing that it's what they'll
eventually ask for."

The factory owner agreed this was a good plan.

"On the other hand," continued the foreman, "it might be that the changes
will never settle down to any final form, in which case there's nothing
much we can do."

This prospect depressed the owner, and he demanded to know whether there
was any way to tell which situation they faced.

"Oh, certainly." said the foreman, "There's a simple way to tell."

He paused.

"It's called the Wire Trousers Hem Test for Uniform Convergence."

This was, of course, made up during an Analysis lecture.

I know most of you people who are "into" math have heard the pun (over and
over and over ...) about knowing the difference between your "asymptote and
a hole in the graph" but here's one you may not have heard. IT'S A TRUE
STORY!

A student at our high school a few years back, having had his fill with
drawing graph after graph in senior high math class, told his teacher:
Mrs. ___, I'll do algebra, I'll do trig, and I'll even do statistics, but
graphing is where I draw the line!

A bunch of Polish scientists decided to flee their repressive
government by hijacking an airliner and forcing the pilot to fly them
to a western country.  They drove to the airport, forced their way on
board a large passenger jet, and found there was no pilot on board.
Terrified, they listened as the sirens got louder.  Finally, one of
the scientists suggested that since he was an experimentalist, he
would try to fly the aircraft.

He sat down at the controls and tried to figure them out.  The sirens
got louder and louder.  Armed men surrounded the jet.  The would be
pilot's friends cried out, "Please, please take off now!!!
Hurry!!!!!!"

The experimentalist calmly replied, "Have patience. I'm just a simple
pole in a complex plane."

A group of Polish tourists is flying on a small airplane through the
Grand Canyon on a sightseeing tour.  The tour guide announces: "On the
right of the airplane, you can see the famous Bright Angle Falls."
The tourists leap out of their seats and crowd to the windows on the
right side.  This causes a dynamic imbalance, and the plane violently
rolls to the side and crashes into the canyon wall.  All aboard are
lost.  The moral to this episode is:  always keep your poles off the
right side of the plane.

Caveat:  While this joke mentions Polish people, it is not, in my
opinion, in the category of the infamous Polish jokes.  I hope no one
is offended but only humored.

A Cherokee indian chief had three wives, each of whom was pregnant.
The first squaw gave birth to a boy, and the chief was so elated he
built her a teepee made of buffalo hide.  A few days later, the second
squaw gave birth, and also had a boy.  The chief was extremely happy;
he built her a teepee made of antelope hide.
The third squaw gave birth a few days later, but the chief kept the
birth details a secret.  He built the woman a teepee out of
hippopotamus hide, and challenged the people in the tribe to guess the
most recent birth details, the correct guesser receiving a fine prize.
Several of his people tried, but were unsuccessful in their guesses.
Finally, a young brave came forth and declared that the third wife had
delivered twin boys.  "Correct"!, cried the chief.  "How did you know"?
 "It's simple", replied the warrior.  "The value of the squaw of the
hippopotamus is equal to the sons of the squaws of the other two hides."
M__________________________________________________________________________
A tribe of Native Americans generally referred to their woman by the
animal hide with which they made their blanket.  Thus, one woman might
be known as Squaw of Buffalo Hide, while another might be known as
Squaw of Deer Hide.  This tribe had a particularly large and strong
woman, with a very unique (for North America anyway) animal hide for
her blanket.  This woman was known as Squaw of Hippopotamus hide, and
she was as large and powerful as the animal from which her blanket was
made.

Year after year, this woman entered the tribal wrestling tournament,
and easily defeated all challengers; male or female.  As the men of
the tribe admired her strength and power, this made many of the other
woman of the tribe extremely jealous.  One year, two of the squaws
petitioned the Chief to allow them to enter their sons together as a
wrestling tandem in order to wrestle Squaw of the Hippopotamus hide as
a team.  In this way, they hoped to see that she would no longer be
champion wrestler of the tribe.

As the luck of the draw would have it, the two sons who were wrestling
as a tandem met the squaw in the final and championship round of the
wrestling contest.  As the match began, it became clear that the squaw
had finally met an opponent that was her equal.  The two sons wrestled
and struggled vigorously and were clearly on an equal footing with the
powerful squaw.  Their match lasted for hours without a clear victor.
Finally the chief intervened and declared that, in the interests of
the health and safety of the wrestlers, the match was to be terminated
and that he would declare a winner.

The chief retired to his teepee and contemplated the great struggle he
had witnessed, and found it extremely difficult to decide a winner.
While the two young men had clearly outmatched the squaw, he found it
difficult to force the squaw to relinquish her tribal championship.
After all, it had taken two young men to finally provide her with a
decent match.  Finally, after much deliberation, the chief came out
from his teepee, and announced his decision.  He said...

"The Squaw of the Hippopotamus hide is equal to the sons of the squaws
of the other two hides"

There were three Medieval kingdoms on the shores of a lake. There was an
island in the middle of the lake, which the kingdoms had been fighting
over for years. Finally, the three kings decided that they would send
their knights out to do battle, and the winner would take the island.

The night before the battle, the knights and their squires pitched camp
and readied themselves for the fight. The first kingdom had 12 knights,
and each knight had 5 squires, all of whom were busily polishing armor,
brushing horses, and cooking food. The second kingdom had 20 knights,
and each knight had 10 squires. Everyone at that camp was also busy
preparing for battle. At the camp of the third kingdom, there was only
one knight, with his squire. This squire took a large pot and hung it
from a looped rope in a tall tree. He busied himself preparing the meal,
while the knight polished his own armor.

When the hour of the battle came, the three kingdoms sent their squires
out to fight (this was too trivial a matter for the knights to join in).
The battle raged, and when the dust cleared, the only person left was
the lone squire from the third kingdom, having defeated the squires from
the other two kingdoms.

Thus proving that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the
sum of the squires of the other two sides.

Now a low collective groan could be heard as everyone looked at
nothing in particular.  The teacher called on Suzy, who got it right
(she has been known to hold back sometimes in front of her friends).

   Wherein it is related how that Polygon of Womanly Virtue, your Polly
Nomial (our heroine) is accosted by that Notorious Villain Curly Pi, and
factored (oh, horror).

   Once upon a time ( 1/T ), Pretty Polly Nomial was strolling across a
field of vectors when she came to the boundary of a singularly large
matrix. Now Polly was convergent and her mother had made it an absolute
condition that she never enter such an array without her brackets on.
Polly, however, who had changed her variables that morning and was feeling
particularly badly behaved, ignored this condition on the basis that it was
insufficient, and made her way amongst the complex elements. Rows and
columns closed in from all sides. Tangents approached her surface. She
became tensor and tensor. Quite suddenly, two branches of a hyperbola
touched her at a single point. She oscillated violently, lost all sense of
directrix, and went completely divergent. As she reached a turning point,
she tripped over a square root that was protruding from the erf and plunged
headlong down a steep gradient. When she rounded off once more, she found
herself inverted, apparently alone, in a non-Euclidian space.
   She was being watched, however. That smooth operator, Curly Pi, was
lurking innerproduct. As his eyes devoured her curvilinear coordinates, a
singular expression crossed his face. He wondered, was she still
convergent? He decided to integrate improperly at once.
   Hearing a common fraction behind her, Polly rotated and saw Curly Pi
approaching with his power series extrapolated.  She could see at once by his
degenerate conic and dissipative terms that he was bent on no good.
   "Arcsinh," she gasped.
   "Ho, ho," he said. "What a symmetric little asymptote you have. I can see
your angles have a lot of secs."
   "Oh, sir," she protested, "keep away from me. I haven't got my brackets
on."
   "Calm yourself, My Dear," said our Suave Operator.  "Your fears are purely
imaginary."
   "I, I," she thought, "perhaps he's not normal but homologous."
   "What order are you?" the Brute demanded.
   "Seventeen," replied Polly.
   Curly leered. "I suppose you've never been operated on."
   "Of course not," Polly replied quite properly. "I'm absolutely
convergent."
   "Come, come," said Curly, "Let's off to a decimal place I know and I'll
take you to the limit."
   "Never," gasped Polly.
   "Abscissa," he swore, using the vilest oath he knew. His patience was
gone. Coshing her over the coefficient with a log until she was powerless,
Curly removed her discontinuities. He stared at her significant places, and
began smoothing out her points of inflection. Poor Polly. The algorithmic
method was now her only hope. She felt his hand tending to her asymptotic
limit. Her convergence would soon be gone forever.
   There was no mercy, for Curly was a heavyside operator. Curly's radius
squared itself; Polly's loci quivered. He integrated by parts. He
integrated by partial fractions. After he cofactored, he performed
rungecutta on her. The complex beast even went all the way around and did a
contour integration. Curly went on operating until he had satisfied her
hypothesis, then he exponentiated and became completely orthogonal.
   When Polly got home that night, her mother noticed that she was no
longer piecewise continuous, but had been truncated in several places. But
is was too late to differentiate now. As the months went by, Polly's
denominator increased monotonically. Finally, she went to the L'Hopital and
generated a small but pathological function which left surds all over the
place and drove Polly to deviation.

   The moral of our sad story is this:
   'If you want to keep your expressions convergent, never allow them a
single degree of freedom...'

     After the earth dries out, Noah tells all the animals to 'go forth

Noah that this is one thing they have never been able to do, hard as
they have tried. Undaunted, Noah instructs the snakes to go into the
woods, make tables from the trunks of fallen trees and give it a try
on the tabletops.
The snakes respond that they don't understand how this will help them
to procreate whereupon Noah explains: "Well, even adders can multiply

            Puns on Theorems
The Royal Chain Mail Factory had received a large order for battle
uniforms. Each uniform consisted of a toga and a pair of short pants. Their
only problem was how long to make the pants: too short and a soldier could
be exposed; too long and a uniform would be excessively heavy. So they
called in a mathematician. He had a uniform made and tested. The hem on the
pants proved to be too short, so he increased it a little bit, then a little
more, and then a little bit more, and so on until finally he was able to
derive an exact trousers-length depending on the leg-length of the soldier.
The chief tailor was curious. "How did you determine this ratio?" he asked?
"Easy," said the mathematician. "I just used the Wire-trousers Hem Test of
Uniform Convergence."

This is a pun on the "Weierstrauss M-test of uniform convergence," where M[k]
is a convergent series of positive real numbers. (It was sent to me by
Andrius Tamulis.) I wonder why M and not, say, N (numeric) or S (sum).
M stands for . . .?

                   THIRTEEN MISUNDERSTANDINGS
                            IN THE
                     HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS

  In the interest of historical accuracy let it be known that
...

1) Fibonacci's daughter was not named "Bunny."
2) Michael Rolle was not Danish, and did not call his
   daughter "Tootsie."
3) William Horner was not called "Little-Jack" by his
   friends.
4) The "G" in G. Peano does not stand for "grand."
5) Rene Descartes' middle name is not "push."
6) Isaac Barrow's middle name is not "wheel."
7) There is no such place as the University of Wis-cosine,
   and if there was, the motto of their mathematics
   department would not be "Secant ye shall find."
8) Although Euler is pronounced oil-er, it does not follow
   that Euclid is pronounced oi-clid.
9) Franklin D. Roosevelt never said "The only thing we have
   to sphere is sphere itself."
10) Fibonacci is not a shortened form of the Italian name that
    is actually spelled: F i bb ooo nnnnn aaaaaaaa
    ccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc
    iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii.
11) It is true that August Mobius was a difficult and
    opinionated man. But he was not so rigid that he could
    only see one side to every question.
12) It is true that Johannes Kepler had an uphill struggle
    in explaining his theory of elliptical orbits to the
    other astronomers of his time. And it is also true that
    his first attempt was a failure. But it is not true that
    after his lecture the first three questions he was asked
    were "What is elliptical?" What is an orbit?" and "What
    is a planet?
13) It is true that primitive societies use only rough
    approximations for the known constants of mathematics.
    For example, the northern tribes of Alaska consider the
    ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle to
    be 3. But it is not true that the value of 3 is called
    Eskimo pi. Incidentally, the survival of these tribes is
    dependent upon government assistance, which is not always
    forthcoming. For example, the Canadian firm of Tait and
    Sons sold a stock of defective compasses to the government
    at half-price, and the government passed them onto the
    northern natives. Hence the saying among these peoples:
    "He who has a Tait's is lost."

=1.7 MATHEMATIC TERMS

M__________________________________________________________________________
                 Definitions of Terms Commonly Used in Higher Math

The following is a guide to the weary student of mathematics who is
often confronted with terms which are commonly used but rarely
defined.  In the search for proper definitions for these terms we
found no authoritative, nor even recognized, source.  Thus, we
followed the advice of mathematicians handed down from time immortal:
"Wing It."


CLEARLY: I don't want to write down all the "in- between" steps.

TRIVIAL: If I have to show you how to do this, you're in the wrong
class.

OBVIOUSLY: I hope you weren't sleeping when we discussed this earlier,
because I refuse to repeat it.

RECALL: I shouldn't have to tell you this, but for those of you who
erase your memory tapes after every test...

WLOG (Without Loss Of Generality): I'm not about to do all the
possible cases, so I'll do one and let you figure out the rest.

IT CAN EASILY BE SHOWN: Even you, in your finite wisdom, should be
able to prove this without me holding your hand.

CHECK or CHECK FOR YOURSELF: This is the boring part of the proof, so
you can do it on your own time.

SKETCH OF A PROOF: I couldn't verify all the details, so I'll break it
down into the parts I couldn't prove.

HINT: The hardest of several possible ways to do a proof.

BRUTE FORCE (AND IGNORANCE): Four special cases, three counting
arguments, two long inductions, "and a partridge in a pair tree."

SOFT PROOF: One third less filling (of the page) than your regular
proof, but it requires two extra years of course work just to
understand the terms.

ELEGANT PROOF: Requires no previous knowledge of the subject matter
and is less than ten lines long.

SIMILARLY: At least one line of the proof of this case is the same as
before.

CANONICAL FORM: 4 out of 5 mathematicians surveyed recommended this as
the final form for their students who choose to finish.

TFAE (The Following Are Equivalent): If I say this it means that, and
if I say that it means the other thing, and if I say the other
thing...

BY A PREVIOUS THEOREM: I don't remember how it goes (come to think of
it I'm not really sure we did this at all), but if I stated it right
(or at all), then the rest of this follows.

TWO LINE PROOF: I'll leave out everything but the conclusion, you
can't question 'em if you can't see 'em.

BRIEFLY: I'm running out of time, so I'll just write and talk faster.

LET'S TALK THROUGH IT: I don't want to write it on the board lest I
make a mistake.

PROCEED FORMALLY: Manipulate symbols by the rules without any hint of
their true meaning (popular in pure math courses).

QUANTIFY: I can't find anything wrong with your proof except that it
won't work if x is a moon of Jupiter (Popular in applied math
courses).

PROOF OMITTED: Trust me, It's true. 

From: ncbauers@ndsuvax.UUCP (Michael Bauers)


Note: This entry was inspired by something I once read in NUTWORKS (The
Computer Humor Magazine.)

This is a guide to translating the language of math textbooks and
professors.

1) It can be proven...

This may take upwards of a year, and no shorter than four hours, and may
require something like 5 reams of scratch paper, 100 pencils, or 100
refills (For those who use mechanical pencils). If you are only an
undergraduate, you need not bother attempting the proof as it will be
impossible for you.

2) It can be shown...

Usually this would take the teacher about one hour of blackboard work, so
he/she avoids doing it. Another possibility of course is that the
instructor doesn't understand the proof himself/herself.

3) It is obvious...

Only to PhD's who specialize in that field, or to instructors who have
taught the course 100 times.

4) It is easily derived...

Meaning that the teacher figures that even the student could derive it. The
dedicated student who wishes to do this will waste the next weekend in the
attempt. Also possible that the teacher read this somewhere, and wants to
sound like he/she really has it together.

5) It is obvious...

Only to the Author of the textbook, or Carl Gauss. More likely only Carl
Gauss. Last time I saw this was as a step in a proof of Fermat's last
theorem.

6) The proof is beyond the scope of this text.

Obviously this is a plot. The reader will never find any text with the
proof in it. The Proof doesn't exist. The theorem just turned out to be
usefull to the author.

7) The proof is left up to the reader.

...sure let us do all the work. Does the author think that we have nothing
better to do than sit around with THEIR textbook, and do the work that THEY
should have done?

8) Sample Proof: .

.

.

4.7 At this point we assume that x is an element of the set S, and
therefore...We know this according to L. Krueger[pg. 71]

Question...has anyone ever bothered to see if these type of references
exist. Come on...we all know what happens when we are writing a fresh- man
english composition and run out of sources...how better to prove your
thesis with a little blurb from some obscure, and nonexistant source

 More recently, I learned another useful term:  "modulo errors."  This is
used, for example, as "Q.E.D., modulo errors."  One fellow often applied
this to his blackboard proofs, meaning:  "This is a representative of an
equivalence class of proofs, one of which is correct and all of which look
sort of like this one.  At least one such proof is correct, but it might
not be the one I wrote down."

 I don't mean to be critical here; the lectures were quite good.  The point
is, a proof "modulo errors" presents the important ideas, and we have
better things to do today than criticize the details.

 For example, many of us who have lectured know the sinking feeling, "ten
or fifteen minutes ago and two blackboards back, I should have called that
variable something besides 'm', because now I'm stuck calling two things
by the same name."  One can rewrite the whole thing, or insert hokey
primes or subscripts.  Or, one can take pity on the students, who after
all are paying $20 an hour to see the show.  In the latter case, just say
"modulo errors," and move on.

 WHAT'S OUT AND WHAT'S IN
FOR
MATHEMATICAL TERMS 

 by
Michael Stueben (November 7, 1994)


 Today it is considered an egregious faux pas to speak or write in the
crude antedated terms of our grandfathers.  To assist the isolated
student and the less sophisticated teacher, I have prepared the
following list of currently fashionable mathematical terms in
academia. I pass this list on to the general public as a matter of
charity and in the hope that it will lead to more refined elucidation
from young scholars.
OUT IN
thinking:                                       hypothesizing.
proof by contradiction or indirect proof:       reductio ad absurdum.
mistake:                                        non sequitur.
starting place:                                 handle.
with corresponding changes:                     mutatis mutandis.
counterexample:                                 pathological exception.

swallowing results:                             digesting proofs.
therefore:                                      ergo.
has an easy-to-understand, but hard-to-find solution: obvious.
has two easy-to-understand, but hard-to-find solutions: trivial.

From: mini-air 1999-01-10       Questionable Math

Mathematicians, as well as their opposite numbers, have responded
eagerly -- and repetitively -- to our essay question "Why is it
only mathematicians who say 'Why is this obvious?'"

More than 80% of the respondents said, "Because." When respondents
answered anything with other than "Because," it usually "Why not?"
Several of the other answers stood out, for various reasons:

"Because mathematics is the only profession in which the
practitioners are intelligent enough to realize that every person
on the planet is, basically, an idiot, and therefore might need
some time in order to comprehend the perfectly obvious."
        -- Investigator J.C. Jamison

"The assertion is patently false. Why is this obvious?"
        -- Investigator B. Kallick

"Given that the abstract algebra professor has red hair, and
teaches ring theory, then this is clearly a red hair ring."
        -- Investigator L. Sherman

"Missing comma. The quote should have been: "Why, is this
obvious?" Much more in line with a mathematical professor's
image."
        -- Investigator Felix Finch

"Because math is the only subject where anything is *allowed* to
be obvious. In any other science, you have to get a grant, run an
experiment, write an excruciatingly equivocated research article,
and have it peer-reviewed and published and cited in at least 3
literature overviews. THEN it's obvious."
        -- Investigator David Lantz

"Q:  Why is this obvious?
 A:  That depends on what your definition of 'is' is."
        -- Investigator T. Rose

"I could tell you why
and it would thrill you.
I could tell you why
and it would chill you.
"Please tell me why,
O will you, will you?"
I could tell you why
but I'd have to kill you."
        -- Investigator Ray Orrange

  ----------------------------------------------------------

1999-01-11      Classic Obviousness

Obviously, there is a rich history to this matter of
mathematicians and the obvious. It is necessary and sufficient to
present three examples:

This is a certifiably non-original story I tell to all math majors
I encounter: One mathematician was showing his new theorem to
another. The colleague pointed at the chalkboard and asked how the
theorem went from one step to the next. The first mathematician
said, "That's obvious." The second went to a second blackboard,
spent an hour filling it up with complex calculations, then
stepped back and said, "You're right, it IS obvious."
        -- Patrick Lenon

It's worth recalling the story of the very famous mathematician
G.H. Hardy, who in a lecture said about some detail in a proof:
"This is obvious." After a pause, he went on: "Hmm, is it really
obvious?" After another pause he left the room to consider the
point, returning 20 minutes later with the verdict: "Yes, I was
right, it is obvious."
        -- J.R. Partington

"The world's most famous mathematician, Humpty Dumpty, speaking
for fellow mathematicians everywhere, said: "When I use a word, it
means precisely what I choose it to mean, neither more nor less".
Mathematicians always say what they mean, even though they do not
mean what they say.  Obviously.

1. Johnny has an AK47 with a 40 round clip. If he misses 6 out of 10 shots
and shoots 15 times each drive by, how many drive by shootings must he
conduct before he shoots 50 people?

Answers to City of Los Angeles High School Math Proficiency Exam


1. Johnny has an AK47 with a 40 round clip. If he misses 6 out of 10 shots
and shoots 15 times each drive by, how many drive by shootings must he
conduct before he shoots 50 people?

 Johnny hits 15*(4/10) people per drive by, which means that he
 will have to participate in 9 drive bys to shoot 50 people.
 However, he will have completed two drive-by shootings and be
 just starting the third when he has to reload. Since he only
 stole a single clip, he'll only have shot 16 people when the
 homeboys with the UZIs' make Swiss cheese out of him.

2. Pony has 2 ounces of cocaine and he sells an 8 ball to Jackson for
$320 and 2 grams to Billy for $85 per gram. What is the street value
of the balance of the cocaine if he doesn't cut it?

 At 454 grams per pound, 2oz of the rock = 56.75 grams. An "8
 ball" is 8 grams, so pony has sold 10 grams total and has 46.75
 grams left. If he keeps selling 8-balls, he can sell 5 more (for
 a total of 5*$320=$1,600) and have 6.75 grams for his own nose.
 If he sells 2 gram packs, he can sell (46/2-23) packs at $85
 apiece = (23*$85)=$1,955. However, he could divide it into small
 parts, bake it up into crack and sell the rocks for an even
 larger profit. This problem is really more suited for the Gang
 Multi-Variable Economics Test.

3. Ron is pimping for 3 girls. If the price is $65 for each trick,
how many tricks will each have to turn so Ron can pay for his $800
per day crack habit.

 800/$64=12 tricks plus a dance. Also, Ron should consider making
 a deal with Pony from Question #2.

4. Susan wants to cut her 1/2 pound of heroin to make 20% more profit.
How many ounces of cut will she need?

 If she sells the cut heroin at the same price per unit volume,
 she will need 20% more volume. 20% of 1/2 pound (=8oz) is 1.6oz.
 So, Susan will need 1.6oz of cut to add to the 8 oz of heroin to
 get 20% more volume. She will want a cut which looks similar to
 raw heroin and has approximately the same melting point. Plain
 sugar or laundry detergent are suggested. Laundry detergent has
 the added benefit of removing the possibility of customer
 complaints, but will sharply limit repeat business.

5. Blade gets $200 for stealing a BMW, $50 for a Chevy, and $100 for
a 4x4. If he has already stolen 2BMW's and 3 4x4's, how many Chevy's
will he have to steal to make $800?

 Blade has made 2*$200 + 3*$100=$700 dollars from his theft so
 far. He needs $100 more, so he needs to steal $100/$50=2 more
 Chevy's. However, he will probably want to steal 4 Chevy's so he
 can take the extra two and make a really def low-rider.

6. Little Willy is in prison for 6 years for murder. He got $25,000
for the hit. If his common law wife is spending $250 per month, how
much money will be left when he gets out of prison and how many
years will he get for killing the bitch that spent his money?

 6 years*12 months/year*$250/month=$18,000. Little Willy will
 have $25,000 - $18,000 = $7,000 left when he gets out of prison.
 If Little Willy kills her in the USA, he should expect to get 6
 years. However, if he takes her down to Mexico and buries her
 scrawny, track-marked butt in the desert, he can get off scott
 free.

7. If the average can of spray paint covers 22 square feet, and
the average letter is 4 square feet, how many letters can a tagger
spray with 3 cans of paint?

 3 cans of paint will cover 3*22=66 square feet. 66/4=16 letters
 with a little paint left over to spray in the eyes of the cop
 who's comin' after you. Or the tagger could do 15 letters and a
 bitchin' skull.

8. Hector knocked up 6 girls in his gang. There are 27 girls in the
gang. What percentage of the girls in the gang has Hector knocked up?

 6/27=22% of the girls. However, 2 of them are lying because
 they've been sleeping with Pedro, Hector's lieutenant. So, in
 actuality, Hector only knocked up 4/27 or 14.8%.

9. Rosie's sole source of income is shoplifting. If she gets 10 cents on
the dollar from her fence, how much merchandise must she shoplift each
week to make $250.

 Solve X/10=250 for X, X=$2,500.

10. Mike carjacked a Chevy Camaro for his date Saturday night with his
young 14 year old girlfriend. He was arrested that night while making his
girlfriend in the backseat. How much prison time is he looking for for the
carjacking and for statutory rape, even though the girl looked legal?
Assume no prior convictions in arriving at your answer.

 Mike is only 12 so he will serve no time and will be making
 his girlfriend in the lot in someone else's car next Saturday.

One of my undergrad professors was asked what kind of of problems
would be on the final. His answer: "Just study the old tests. The
problems will be be the same, just the numbers will be different.
But not all the numbers will be different. Pi will be the same.
Planck's constant will be the same... "


Another professor, when asked how many problems there would be on
the final, turned to the student and replied, "I think you will
have lots of problems on the final."

This isn't really a joke, it supposedly happened in a UK GCSE exam some
years ago, but it may amuse you:

question: how many times can you subtract 7 from 83, and what is left
afterwards?
answer: I can subtract it as many times as I want, and it leaves 76 every
time.

I don't know of that one.  But when I was an undergrad, one of my
professors told me that when he was a student, and he had trouble with a
proof trying to get past step n to step n+1, he would always start with
"Clearly ..."  Although, he said, he'd get a few points off for "needing
more detail at this step", his professor thought that he knew what he
had to do, so he'd largely get away with it.

He also informed us that because he knew the trick, he was not likely to
be fooled if we tried to pull that stunt.  :-)

I think the one you might be referring to shows a proof that starts at the
beginning and goes partway. It then picks up again and proceeds to the end.
In the middle between the two parts is a something like, => Then a miracle
occurs =>

The professor, looking at the proof, comments, "You need to be a little more
explicit here in step two."

Once, when I was grading an exam, I got a paper that had the right answer to
four sig figs. But the problem had been set up incorrectly from the very
first line. I was therefore all geared up to ream this student a new one for
cheating - or for the very least for employing "magical methods" which is
quite common when the answers to a problem are in the back of the book.

As I worked through this student's work, it turned out that they had made
three separate errors - they had set the problem up completely wrong. They
had taken a quantity from one side of the equation to the other and didn't
flip the sign and they had added to fractions over different denominators by
simply adding the denominators. The last two math blunders are common
mistakes (and I firmly believe that the level of skill necessary to walk the
correct answer back to the initial work and tie it in through the use of
these devices was way beyond this student's reach). But, it turned out that
that the combination of the three unrelated errors just happen to yield the
right answer to four sig figs.

While I found this very intriguing and interesting, I graded the problem
just as though the answer had only been close. But I did layout this
peculiar coincidence to the entire class. I was surprised by the number of
students that truly felt that the guy should have received full credit for
the problem since, "Why should it matter HOW the answer is arrived at, as
long as it's correct." BTW: The guy whose paper it was agreed that the
answer deserved no more credit than any incorrect result.

The guy that was the most vocal about how unfair this was wouldn't let it
go, so I asked him, "Let's say you went to a doctor with a certain ailment
and he gave you a prescription and you took it and got better. You then
found out that he had misdiagnosed your ailment completely. He looked up the
treatment in the Physician's Desk Reference, but read the wrong line from
the index and so turned to yet another ailment in the book. When writing the
prescription he then transposed some numbers in the dosage. The end result,
purely by coincidence, it that you got a prescription for the right medicine
in the right dosage and everything worked. Would you be eager to give that
doctor full credit and go back to him again? Or would you say, "I'm sure
happy that you got lucky, but your license to practice should be yanked
immediately."

    Another version I've heard is that when the student gets the paper back he
sees a -1 on that problem which has been crossed out.  A note on the back
explains that the grader at first didn't think that this step was obvious, but
after thinking about it for an hour, decided that it was.

Once, in a "math appreciation" course, part of a test I gave
had some one-variable linear equations to solve. Most of this
course was "algebra-free" since many of the students had very
weak backgrounds in math. However, solving one-variable linear
equations was one of the topics covered and this test was
given after that topic had been covered.

Question -- Solve for x:  3x - 2 = x.

Student asks during test -- "I can solve for x on the left side,
but what do I do with the x on the right side?"

Similar one: "Let S =1+1/4+1/16+...+1/4^n; calculate 4S and deduce the value

ok,  I have calculated forty-five; what do I do now"?
 It took me a few minutes to understand :-)

As a freshmem in college some of my friends had to take a trigonometry
refresher course before they could proceed to calculus.  On one of the
exams the students were asked what sin(x)/cos(x) equaled.  Obviously the

sin(x)/cos(x) =3D in/co

economics.

I asked "Is there a smallest positive real number.  Why or why not?"

A student wrote:  "There is no smallest positive real number, because
if you thought you had found the smallest positive real number, you
could divide it in half a get a smaller one."

Full credit.  But he went on:

"Then you can take the result of that calculation, divide it in half
and get still a smaller one.  Then you can divide in half again to get
something still smaller.  Then you can do it again.  This process
generates a sequence that goes on forever.  It is infantile."

Dear fellow parent!

This message is for you and the children around you.

What is more valuable for you and your child: a lollypop, a bagful of
plastic stuff in a party favor, a box of mints or a meaningful and
enjoyable half-hour with your loved one? Either one will cost you about the
same - one dollar.

Are you aware of the depressing statistics of recent international science
contests for school children? Do you know that American children regularly
score very poorly (to say the least) in basic quizzes, failing to provide
adequate answers to simple questions like "When does your mom put more
pressure on the floor: when she wears high and thin heels or low and thick
ones?" Does it concern you?

If your answer is yes, you might be interested in further reading. If no -
pass this message on to someone who might care about the subject.

We are a happy family with three children who enjoy an untraditional way of
learning math, logic and basic physics.

We put together problems on the basis of our children's school curriculum
for practice and as a quality pastime with the children. In fact we have
written a book of these problems, hoping that it might be a good idea to
publish it later on.

Please take at least a scanning look through the problems below.


                             MATH'O'RIDDLES

1. Two groups of 12 Lower Division kids came to a Zoo for a field trip. The
class gathered around a cage with 15 lazy tigers. Watching those healthy
looking children the tigers got real hungry,  escaped from the cage and ate
some of the kids.

How many scared kids survived if each tiger's tummy can hold only 1 child?

2. 40 old ladies came to an old man's birthday party. Each and every one of
those joyful ladies brought 2 combs as a gift for the old man.

How many combs did this entirely bald old man get for his birthday?

3. After a Water Conservation lecture most of the Lower Division students
decided not to run the water. One half of the Lower Division came to school
with dirty hands, and the other half with dirty faces.

How many students are there in the Lower Division if 190 boys and 146 girls
came to school with dirty faces?

4. One rainy morning elephant Gary in a local Zoo got 35 buckets of
drinking water with ice.  By 3 o'clock in the afternoon he had finished the
21st bucket and decided to use the rest of the buckets to water the Zoo
manager.

How much water did Gary use to please the Zoo manager on that cold and
windy day?

5. Students of the 2nd grade have 44 ears. Their math teacher has 42 ears
less.

How many ears are there in the classroom?

her paper and copied everything) made 29 errors.

How many of his own errors did Bobbie make?

7. How many holes did Andy's mom find in the tablecloth after Andy pierced
it 12 times with a 4-tooth fork?

8. A family with 2 well-behaved sisters is having a Friday night dinner at
home. Their little brother is under the table: he is busy cutting one of
the table's legs with a band saw. The tireless boy is working at the speed
of 1/2 inch of the table's leg per minute.

How long will the dinner last if the table's leg is 3 inches thick?

9. 12 very strict teachers set up a special meeting with the purpose of
scolding one troublemaker from the 2nd grade. Each teacher took 15 minutes
worth of scolding the student.

How long did this unpleasant meeting last?

10. An Olympic hotdog is 75 centimeters long.

How long it will take for a gold medallist to finish the dog if he eats at
the speed of 25 centimeters a minute?  What about the silver and bronze
medallists? They eat dogs at the speed of 15 and 10 centimeters a minute
respectively.

11. Stacey's mother had a few very expensive pieces of jewelry. Stacey just
learned at school that airplanes can fly. She threw half of her mom's
jewelry out in a window to see if jewelry can fly and swim in the pond
below.

How many pieces of jewelry flew out of the window and struggled in the
water if 3 rings and 2 necklaces was all her mommy had left after the
experiment?

12. Mr. Black proposed to Ms. White to marry him. She promised to think
about it. She thought for 15 years and refused. Mr. Black proposed
again. Ms. White was thinking 6 years longer than the first time and agreed
to marry him.

  A ten year old boy was failing math.  His parents tried everything from
tutors to hypnosis, but to no avail.  Finally, at the insistence of a
family friend, they decided to enroll their son in a private Catholic
school.
  After the first day, the boy's parents were surprised when he walked in
after school with a stern, focused and very determined expression on his
face, and went right past them straight to his room, where he quietly
closed the door.
  For nearly two hours he toiled away in his room - with math books strewn
about his desk and the surrounding floor. He emerged long enough to eat,
and after quickly cleaning his plate, went straight back to his room,
closed the door, and worked feverishly at his studies until bedtime.
  This pattern continued ceaselessly until it was time for the first
quarter report card.
  The boy walked in with his report card -- unopened -- laid it on the
dinner table and went straight to his room.  Cautiously, his mother opened
it, and to her amazement, she saw a bright red "A" under the subject of
MATH.  Overjoyed, she and her husband rushed into their son's room,
thrilled at his remarkable progress.
  "Was it the nuns that did it?", the father asked. The boy only shook his
head and said, "No."
  "Was it the one-on-one tutoring? The peer-mentoring?"
  "No."
  "The textbooks?  The teachers?  The curriculum?"
  "Nope," said the son. "On that first day, when I walked in the front
door and saw that guy they nailed to the 'plus sign,' I just knew they
meant business!"

Friends, Countrymen, fellow Netizens lend me your eyes:

       season's greetings, peace and prosperity to all

Today in this TK session, i shall talk about something which is dear to
our hearts, nostrils and intestines - namely the elusive true secret to
success in Mathematics, which is a grave concern of all students,
parents, principals, teachers, aunties and pet hamsters alike.  Without
further ado, by your leave, allow me to share with you

                THE TRUE SECRET TO SUCCESS IN MATHEMATICS

     Once upon a time in a remote island far, far away in the deep recesses
of Hilbert Space, there lived a boy called BoyBoy who was having a long
history of problems with mathematics in school.  He also had a low
self-esteem and just was not interested.  As a concerned parent, his
mother, called MaMa, tried all sorts of ways to encourage, coax, threaten,
cajole him into performing in mathematics.  This included caning, buying
him expensive toys, nagging, buying him his favourite computer games, more
nagging, bringing him to all the places he longed to visit, even more
nagging ... etc.  And all these to no avail.
     BoyBoy's mother even went up to the school to talk to the school maths
teacher Pierre Simon Lagrange XXIV, a recent 'A'-level graduate substitute
teacher with absolutely no teaching experience at all, and asked : "What is
the true secret of success in mathematics, O Wise and Erudite Teacher?".
And thus spake the inexperienced relief-teacher: "Every day eat one hundred
bulbs of garlic and one hundred bulbs of onions, look in the mirror and
repeat the phrase 'I love Maths' one hundred times."  Upon hearing this
BoyBoy's mother was shocked and disillusioned.  She was disappointed at the
school authorities for hiring an untrained teacher who uttered such utter
nonsense.
     BoyBoy's mother decided to engage the services of a tutor.  So she
called a tuition agency, who recommended a tutor called Issac Galois XIII.
This part-time tutor is an engineering graduate with some experience in
teaching and charged 10 cents per month.  Of course, 5 cents commission was
due to the agency, at the expense of the tutor.  BoyBoy's mother asked the
tutor: "What is the true secret of success in mathematics, O Wise and
Erudite Teacher?".  And thus spake the part-time tutor: "Every day eat one
hundred bulbs of garlic and one hundred bulbs of onions, look in the mirror
and repeat the phrase 'I love Maths' one hundred times."  Upon hearing this
BoyBoy's mother was infuriated and summarily sacked the engineer.  She
still had to pay the 10 cents, of which 5 cents goes to the agency.
     Frustrated, BoyBoy's mother thought to herself: "I shan't trust these
agencies anymore.  I shall look for a tutor myself."  So she scoured the
newspapers and soon found a tutor by the name of Stephen Gauss IX, a
mathematics graduate with 1 year experience in teaching.  This tutor
charged $10 per month for a minimum of 12 months.  A year and $120 later,
BoyBoy still had no progress in mathematics and BoyBoy's mother began to
feel a little panicky.  So she asked the tutor: "What is the true secret of
success in mathematics, O Wise and Erudite Teacher?".  And thus spake the
part-time tutor: "Every day eat one hundred bulbs of garlic and one hundred
bulbs of onions, look in the mirror and repeat the phrase 'I love Maths'
one hundred times."  Upon hearing this BoyBoy's mother experienced deja vu
and decided to discontinue this tutor's services.
     Now BoyBoy's mother was disappointed but she did not give up.  She
asked among her friends for a recommendation and was soon referred to
Leonhard Archimedes V, a trained full-time tutor, graduate of the
world-famous Camford University with 10 years' teaching experience,
charging $1000 per month for a minimum of 5 years.  This tutor gave BoyBoy
copious amounts of notes, summaries, tips, homework, past-year examination
papers from the top schools for practice, more homework, hands-on model
making, more homework, Internet explorations with Java-powered animations
and 3D-VRML live demonstrations, field trips to Mathematical places,
creative visualisations, mind bending exercises, IQ stretching exercises,
more homework and vast array of demonstrations with exotic gadgets, curious
contraptions and other paraphernalia....  This really impressed BoyBoy's
mother a lot.  However at the end of the 5 years, there was only marginal
progress.  And BoyBoy's mother began to feel rather panicky and began to
wonder if this tutor was holding back any secrets.  So she confronted this
tutor asking: "What is the true secret of success in mathematics, O Wise
and Erudite Teacher?".  And thus spake the Camford-graduate tutor: "Every
day eat one hundred bulbs of garlic and one hundred bulbs of onions, look
in the mirror and repeat the phrase 'I love Maths' one hundred times."
     Upon hearing this BoyBoy's mother was experienced cognitive
dissonance.  However, since the tutor was from Camford and was charging
$1000 per month, he must know something, so reasoned BoyBoy's mother.
Consequently she decided to give this tutor the benefit of the doubt and
try out his advice.  The next day after making BoyBoy eat the garlic and
onions and recite the 'I love Maths' slogan as prescribed (much to BoyBoy's
protest), BoyBoy's mother bundled him to school.  Then everybody avoided
BoyBoy, even his girl-friend of 9 years dumped him.  The experience left
him utterly miserable.
     BoyBoy, now in his late adolescent years, felt that enough was enough
and decided to assert his independence.  He plucked up enough courage to
speak to his mother, saying "MaMa, I think I do not need you to look for
tutors for me anymore.  I know the importance of being good at maths.  You
need not worry about me. I shall look for Carl Hawking I, the Ultimate
Tutor myself."  Incidentally Boyboy had learned about the Carl Hawking I,
the Ultimate Tutor from his web page in the Internet.  A double PhD from
Stanvard University, three time Field's Medallist (mathematical equivalent
of Nobel Prize), the Ultimate Tutor had 100 years' experience in teaching
and had solved the Remand Hypothesis, Goldmine Conjecture and proved the
Quasi-contravariant K-27-Hyperbundle Global Chromatic Embedding Theorem,
all before the age of 12.  Now he is meditating in some remote mountain in
the upper reaches of the Continuum.
     Of course BoyBoy's mother was touched.  On the other hand she was
worried as the journey into the Continuum was long and arduous and fraught
with dangers.  However BoyBoy insisted on going.  Boyboy's mother wanting
the best for her son, was faced with Hobson's choice. She packed lots of
water and rations, instant noodles, a portable stove, herbs, tonics and
ginseng before tearfully sending him away.
     After crossing several oceans, traversing a few deserts, cutting
through a multitude of thick jungles, trekking along meandering rivers one
after another and trudging along through fields upon fields of snow, BoyBoy
arrived at the foot of the Continuum.  Then he began his mile-long vertical
ascent of the Continuum.  After reaching the summit, BoyBoy still had to
spend six months locating Carl Hawking I, the Ultimate Tutor's, by which
time BoyBoy was extremely exhausted, hungry, thirsty, bruised and scarred.
He plodded his way to greet the Ultimate Tutor, saying : "O Master,
Ultimate Tutor, I have long sought for thee and at last I have found thee.
I pray thee, tell me, what is the true secret of success in mathematics, O
Wise and Erudite Teacher?".  The Master with a mile-long white beard,
though slightly annoyed by the interruption, was impressed by BoyBoy's
sincerity.  And thus spake Carl Hawking I, the Ultimate Tutor: "My son, my
dear son, the time is not ripe for thee to receive the answer, for thine
heart is not yet purified.  Go thou, wash my beard every day for ten
years.".  Boyboy's heart sank but he did as he was told.  Daily for the
next ten years Boyboy washed the Master's mile-long white beard, which was
often littered with yak excrement.  Yet Boyboy endured the stench, being so
delighted to have found wisdom and true meaning in life.  He also noted
that as he washed nearer the Master, there was another kind of smell that
somehow neutralised the odour of the yak excrement, but could not figure
out what it was.  Also occasionally, BoyBoy overheard the Master mumbling
something from afar as he washed, but could not make out what it was.  All
these added to the intrigue and stoked the flames of curiosity burning in
the young man's breast.  And at the end of ten long years, BoyBoy, a man by
now, could not hide his urgency when he asked: "O Master, Ultimate Tutor, I
have religiously cleaned your beard for ten years daily without fail and
have purified my heart.  Now I beseech thee, tell me, what is the true
secret of success in mathematics, O Wise and Erudite Teacher?". And thus
spake the Ultimate Tutor: "Every day eat one hundred bulbs of garlic and
one hundred bulbs of onions, look in the mirror and repeat the phrase 'I
love Maths' one hundred times."  Upon hearing this BoyBoy felt betrayed,
and protested : "But, O Master, that was what all my earlier tutors said.".
And thus replied the Ultimate Tutor : "If I said that in the beginning, you
wouldn't have believed me, would you?".

The Moral of the Story is: Every day eat one hundred bulbs of garlic and
one hundred bulbs of onions, look in the mirror and repeat the phrase 'I
love Maths' one hundred times AND FOR GOODNESS SAKE COVER YOUR MOUTH!

Little Johnny was busy doing his homework. As his
mother approached she heard:
"One and one, the son-of-a-bitch is two."
"Two and two, the son-of-a-bitch is four."
"Three and three... "
His mother interrupted, asking where he had learned
this way of doing math. Johnny remarked that his
teacher Ms. Clara Jones taught him.
His mother was rather upset and told him to stop the
homework.
The next day she approached Ms. Jones and told her
what happened. The teacher was flabbergasted. She said
that she couldn't understand why Johnny had said what
he did.
Then suddenly, Ms Jones exclaimed, "Oh, I know... here
in school we say, one and one, the sum-of-which is
two."

A somewhat advanced society has figured how to package basic knowledge
in pill form.

A student, needing some learning, goes to the pharmacy and asks what
kind of knowledge pills are available.  The pharmacist says "Here's a
pill for English literature."  The student takes the pill and swallows
it and has new knowledge about English literature!

"What else do you have?" asks the student.

"Well, I have pills for art history, biology, and world history,"
replies the pharmacist.

The student asks for these, and swallows them and has new knowledge
about those subjects.

Then the student asks, "Do you have a pill for math?"

The pharmacist says "Wait just a moment", and goes back into the
storeroom and brings back a whopper of a pill and plunks it on the
counter.

"I have to take that huge pill for math?" inquires the student.

The pharmacist replied "Well, you know math always was a little hard
to swallow."

The following story is true, I was a personal witness. A math-prof (his
nickname was "Lord Number") was talking quite a while on "n-dimensional
manifolds". He was *far* off comprehension of most of the listeners and
finally adressed his audience: "So what do you think is the volume of an
infinite-dimensional unit-sphere ?"

Silence. After a while a voice from the backrows: "42 !" That did it.

P.S.: Actually, this volume is zero (!).
It is inverse proportional to a Gammafunction depending on n.

A commentary on the teaching of mathematics, sent in by James
Jackson of Carlisle, Ind., appeared in "Echoes" (winter 1994),
published by Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, Terre Haute, Ind.
"Echoes" took it from the 1993-94 issue of "21st Century" (not
otherwise identified).  The commentary takes the form of a series
of story problems:

In 1960: A logger sells a truckload of lumber for $100.  His cost
of production is four-fifths of this price.  What is his profit?

In 1970: A logger sells a truckload of lumber for $100.  His cost
of production is four-fifths of this price, or $80.  What is his
profit?

In 1970 (new math): A logger exchanges a set L of lumber for a set
M of money.  The cardinalitiy of set M is 100, and each element is
worth $1.00.  Make 100 dots representing the elements of the set M.
The set C of the costs of production contains 20 fewer points than
set M.  Represent the set C as a subset of M, and answer the
following question: What is the cardinality of the set P of points?

In 1980: A logger sells a truckload of wood for $100.  His cost of
production is $80, and his profit is $20.  Your assignment:
underline the number 20.

In 1990 (outcome-based education): By cutting down beautiful forest
trees, a logger makes $20.  What do you think of this way of making
a living?  (Topic for class participation: How did the forest birds
and squirrels feel?)

From: Mark Mihalasky <mjm@geol.uottawa.ca>
In 1997 (profit-driven education): By laying off %40 of the its loggers, a
company improves its stock price from $80 to $100.  How much capital gain
per share does the CEO make by exercising his stock options at $80?  Assume
capital gains are no longer taxed, because Republicans feel this encourages
investment.

The Evolution of Teaching Math

Up to the 1960's
A peasant sells a bag of potatoes for $10.
His costs amount to 4/5 of his selling price.
What is his profit?

In the early 1970 s
A farmer sells a bag of potatoes for $10.
His costs amount to 4/5 of his selling price, i.e., $8.
What is his profit?

1970's (new math)
A farmer exchanges a set P of potatoes with a set M of money.
The cardinality of the set M is equal to $10 and each element of M is
worth $1.
Draw 10 big dots representing the elements of M.
The set of production cost is comprised of 2 big dots less then the set
M.
Represent C as a subset of M and give the answer to the question:
What is the cardinality of the set of profits?

1980 s
A farmer sells a bag of potatoes for $10.
His production costs are $8 and his profit is $2.
Underline, the word "potatoes" and discuss with our classmates.

1990's
A farmer sells a bag of potatoes for $10.00.
His production costs are 0.80 of his revenue.
On your calculator graph revenue versus costs.
Run the "POTATO" program on your computer to determine the profit.
Discuss the result with the other students in your group.

Teaching Math
Teaching Math in 1950:
A logger sells a truckload of lumber for $100.
His cost of production is 4/5 of the price. What is his profit?

Teaching Math in 1960:
A logger sells a truckload of lumber for
 His cost of production is 4/5 of the price, or $80. What is his profit?

Teaching Math in 1970:
A logger exchanges a set "L" of lumber for a set "M" of money.
The cardinality of set "M" is 100. Each element is worth one dollar.
Make 100 dots representing the elements of the set "M".
The set "C", the cost of production, contains 20 fewer points than set "M."
Represent the set "C" as a subset of set "M" and answer the following
question:
What is the cardinality of the set "P" for profits?

Teaching Math in 1980:
A logger sells a truckload of lumber for $100.
Her cost of production is $80 and her profit is $20.
Your assignment: Underline the number 20.

Teaching Math in 1990:
By cutting down beautiful forest trees, the logger makes $20.
What do you think of this way of making a living?
Topic for class participation after answering the question:
How did the forest birds and squirrels feel as the logger cut down the
trees?
There are no wrong answers.

Teaching Math in 1996:
By laying off 40% of its loggers, a company improves its stock price from
$80 to $100. How much capital gain per share does the CEO make by exercising
his stock options at $80? Assume capital gains are no longer taxed, because
this encourages investment.

Teaching Math in 1997:
A company out-sources all of its loggers. The firm saves on benefits, and
when demand for its product is down, the logging work force can easily be
cut back. The average logger employed by the company earned $50,000, had
three weeks vacation, a nice retirement plan and medical insurance. The
contracted logger charges $50 an hour.
Was out-sourcing a good move?

Teaching Math in 1998: A laid-off logger with four kids at home and a
ridiculous alimony from his first failed marriage comes into the logging
company's corporate offices and goes postal, mowing down 16 executives and a
couple of secretaries, and gets lucky when he nails a politician on the
premises collecting his kickback.
Was outsourcing the loggers a good move for the company?

Teaching Math in 1999:
A laid-off logger serving time in Folsom for blowing
away several people is being trained as a COBOL programmer in order to work
on Y2K projects.

A student was doing miserably on his oral final exam in General Toplogy
(yes, this guy _really_ did give oral finals in topology). Exasperated by
the student's abysmal performance up to that point, the professor asked the
student "So, what _do_ you know about topology?" The student replied, "I
know the definition of a topologist." The professor asked him to state the
definition, expecting to get the old saw about someone who can't tell the
difference between a coffee cup and a doughnut. Instead, the student
replied: "A topologist is someone who can't tell the difference between his
ass and a hole in the ground, but who can tell the difference between his
ass and _two_ holes in the ground."

The student passed.

I saw the following in "The Knot Book" by Colin Adams (a very readable
introduction to Knot Theory).  The joke is attributed to Joel Haas.

A woman walks into a bar accompanied by a dog and a cow.  The bartender
says, "Hey, no animals are allowed in here."
The woman replies, "These are very special animals."
"How so?"
"They're knot theorists."
The bartender raises his eyebrows and says, "I've met a number of
knot theorists who I thought were animals, but never an animal that
was a knot theorist."
"Well, I'll prove it to you.  Ask them them anything you like."
So the bartender asks the dog, "Name a knot invariant."
"Arf, arf" barks the dog.
The bartender scowls and turns to the cow asking, "Name a topological
invariant."
The cow says, "Mu, mu."
At this point the bartender turns to the woman, says, "Just what are
you trying to pull" and throws them out of the bar.

Outside, the dog turns to the woman and asks, "Do you think I should
have said the Jones polynomial?"

Here's a new one, tell me what you think.

	A topologist comes home from work to find his wife and daughter
wailing and sobbing buckets.  A police officer, who was trying to console
them, greeted the topologist with a somber expression.  "I have terrible
news for you," he said.  "While at school, your son Dave was hit by
a steamroller and squashed flat.  We tried to contact you immediately,
but you had left your office before we could reach you."

	The mathematician spent a few minutes in horrified disbelief.
"Did he ... did he die instantly?  Was he taken to the hospital?"

 	"He died within the few seconds it took for the vehicle to run
him over,"  the officer said.  "He was in pain, but only for a short time.
We need you to come down to the morgue."

	So together they went to the city morgue.  The officer watched
as the mathematician was shown the body, a broken and flattened wreck.
"Can you identify him as your son?"  the police officer asked.

	"No," said the topologist, "but I think I can identify a pair
of antipodal points."

	Needs work?  Okay, needs work.

A topologist walks into a bar and orders a drink.  The bartender,
being a number theorist, says, "I'm sorry, but we don't serve
topologists here."

The disgruntled topologist walks outside, but then gets an idea and
performs Dahn surgery upon herself.  She walks into the bar, and the
bartender, who does not recognize her since she is now a different
manifold, serves her a drink.  However, the bartender thinks she looks
familiar, or at least locally similar, and asks, "Aren't you that
topologist that just came in here?"

To which she responds, "No, I'm a frayed knot."

A piece of string walked into a small town on a hot, dusty day.
He was thirsty, so he sauntered into the first establishment he
encountered and asked the waiter for a glass of water.

"Sorry", said the waiter, "we don't serve strings here."

Discouraged, the string walked out.  A little further down the
street, he met a stranger.

"You look hot," said the stranger.  "Why don't you go into that
cafe and get a drink of water?"

"I tried that," said the string, "but the waiter wouldn't serve
me anything because I'm just a string."

"No problem" said the stranger.  "I'll fix you up."  He grabbed
the string, tied him in a bowline and frayed his ends.  "Now try it."

The string slipped back into the cafe and asked the waiter for a
glass of water.  "Hey," said the waiter, "aren't you the piece of
string that was just in here?"

"Nope," retorted the string, "I'm a frayed knot."

A young private lived in a barracks infested with fleas and ticks, and
though he complained often to the sergeant of his platoon, nothing was
ever done about the problem.  However, one weekend he received a
weekend pass, and went to the nearby town to party it up with his
friends.  Unbeknownst to him, the barracks was disinfected and
fumigated while he was away.

Upon his return, he looked at his bed and said, "Oh, well, another
night of bug-bites and itching ahead..."

And the bed replied, "No, I'm a sprayed cot."

A young executive was working at her desk late one night, when she
accidentally knocked over a bottle of ink.  The ink began running
toward the project she was working on, and she hastily wiped at it
with a Kleenex.  Assuming she had eradicated the offensive substance,
she finished up what she was doing and left for the night.

When she arrived in the morning, she began leafing through her papers,
and discovered one sheet had a large ink stain on it.  She swore, then
turned to the ink bottle and said, "Ooh, I thought I wiped you up last
night!"

The spot on the page looked at her and said, "No, I'm a strayed blot."

So there was this guy in the old ages in shining armor, in Camelot.
He had been set-up by a nemesis, and was doing some time in the
dungeon, for a crime he didn't commit.  Another inmate asked,

You must have done something horrible to get in here."
And our hero said "No, I'm a framed knight."

He was able to prove his innocence, and was let go.
He ran into his nemesis who was surprised to see him loose.

"I thought you were locked up for good?"

"No," said our hero, "I'm a freed knight."

These three Australian Pecans went into a bar that only served
Peanuts.  As the first Pecan approached the bar, the bartender axed,
'Hey, what are you?  A Pecan?  We don't serve Pecans here, only
Peanuts.'  So the poor Pecan left.

As you may guess, the second Pecan attempted the same thing and was
also turned away.

The third Australian Pecan got a good idea.  He went outside and threw
himself on a barbie and rolled around in the coals for a bit.  He
returned to the bar and approached the bartender who axed, 'Hey,
aren't you one of them Pecans?'

To which our hero replied: 'No, I'm a fried nut.'

An old, arthritic, and exceptionally stupid dog was snoozing in the
middle of the road.  Alluva sudden a big street cleaning vehicle comes
by and maims the dogster, tossing him to the side of the road.  Some
time later, a yuppie couple stop in their BMW 535i and pull over to
see how the dog is. "Good Lord," sez the guy, "Are you all right?"
To which the dog replies,  "No, I'm a flayed mutt."

Sally's pen explodes and a large splat of black ink drops onto her
lapel.  After many bleachings and washings, the stain had faded but
showed no sign of coming out altogether.  She exclaimed one day, "You

The local newspaper reporter was covering the catastrophic fire at the
psychiatric ward of the hospital.  Wanting to get his story straight
about who and how many were injured he question many of the people at
the scene.  So far everyone of the injured was a member of the staff.
Coming to a man who had been seriously burned when the oil furnace
exploded he asked, "Are you a doctor or a nurse too?"  "No," came the
reply, "I'm a fried nut."

There once was a magical kingdom where the princess of the castle was
turned into a small amphibian by an evil witch.  She was held prisoner
by the witch for many years, until one day a handsome prince rescued
her from the witch's cottage in the woods.  The prince asked, "Excuse

Actually, this musician was melting butter in a pan on the stove not

After Alexander (the Great) applied his famous solution to the Gordian
knot, he and his soldiers continued on their merry way leaving the
severed knot to lie on the ground in two tangled piles.  One soldier,
who was quite far back in the column and had not seen the action
earlier, had this to say:

Look at the size of those two piles of worms!!!

To which the knot replied, as all good knots will,

  No, I'm a filleted knot.

It was the late 1950's, and actor Don Knotts was temporarily out of
work.  He happened to hear that Hanna-Barbera was looking for voices
for the characters in its new animated series, "The Flintstones".
After his first audition, he was told that he had a good shot at the
voice of Barney Rubble, but in the meantime he should go out into the
front lounge to wait for further news.  The lounge turned out to be
filled with actors and actresses who were there to audition for the
voices of Fred, Barney, Wilma and Betty.  Don noticed an old friend of
his across the room, a Mr. Chisteviejo.  Don walked up to his friend,
slapped him on the back, and said, "Say, Chisteviejo, are you a 'Fred'
or a 'Barney'?"  Without hesitation, Chisteviejo replied:

"I'm a 'Fred', Knotts . . . "

So these two acorns were dangling side-by-side on a branch of their
mighty oak, when a starling landed.  The larger of the acorns dropped
to the ground below.  The fallen acorn surveyed the situation, and
excitedly reported back to its once-neighbor, "What a feeling of
freedom down here!  With each rustle of wind, I can roll, the ground
is cool and damp, and when a dog or person strolls by, the whole earth
seems to vibrate.  This is great.  Do you want'a come down?"
To which the still suspended acorn just HAD to reply, "No, I'm a treed nut."


A massive lightning strike hit a pond near my house one day, and
boiled all the water out.  The next day, I went back to the blasted
mudhole (nee pond) and noticed a large number of amphibian bodies

if it had been a frog, when I heard it reply...
   "No, I'm a fried newt!"

A fishing vessel is dragging its net through an area rich with fish.
Unexpectedly, a rat chews the main line through and the net goes
sinking into the deep, much to the dismay of the crew.  At the ocean
floor, an octopus and a squid look at the strange thing that has
fallen upon them.  The octopus, irritated, looks at it and says, "What
the hell are you, some kind of strange fish?

A group of planter's peanuts were out for a stroll one day in the
kitchen. Unsalted thought that it might be fun to go for a stroll on
the big deep-fryer that was sitting on the counter.  They climbed up a
wooden spoon that was leaning against the vat, and began to walk
around the edge.  Honey-roasted lost her balance and fell in.
Unsalted, quite alarmed, looked down into the vat and shouted, "Are
you alright, Honey?"

      Honey surfaced, looked at him, and replied,
	 "No, I'm a fried nut."

An ignorant fool posted some anti-homosexual blathering over all of
the newsgroups on USENET, in order to gain complete recognition by all
of its members.  For months the flames soared and the poor little
homophobe had to unsubscribe to most of them.  One day FIDONET
happened by and looked at the weary USENET.  "You look pretty bad.
Are you OK?" he asked.
The reply from the weary network was, "No, I'm a fried net."

When I was in boot camp at Parris Island, one young marine was
extremely clumsy, dropping his rifle several times during the daily

range as you are on the field?"
To which was replied, "No sir, I'm a great shot."

still bright red, as it had been when they were boys.

"Och, ye maun weel know", Ginger replied ...

Two zeros are walking down the street.  One zero is coughing very
badly.  The coughing is getting severe, so his buddy asks him: "Are
you all right?"
The second zero responds: "No, I'm a phlegmed naught."

----------------------------------------------------

These three zeroes were travelling through some cold weather and
became thirsty, so they stopped in at a local bar for some warmth &
refreshments.  When the first zero approached the bar, the bartender
(whose mathematical skill didn't quite reach the level of familiarity
with single-digit numbers, asked, "Say, aren't you a zero?  We don't
serve zeros here."

The second zero tried to order and the bartender said "You're a zero
too, aren't you?  I already told your friend, no zeros allowed!"

The last zero, before approaching the bar, stepped outside & rolled in
the snow for several minutes until he was quite cold.  When he
re-entered the building and walked up to the bar, the bartender said
"Not again!  You'd better not be another zero!"

To which the cold number replied, "No, I'm a frigid naught!"

The president of the Flintstones Fan Club walked into a bar, and the

A small lizard was minding its own business when a knight rode up and,
thinking the lizard to be a dragon, attacked it and bashed it over its
head with a heavy ball-and-chain.
Not much later, another knight (a former bartender) spotted the hurt
lizard and asked, "Say, are you a wounded dragon?"
The lizard, still dizzy from the blow, replied, "No, I'm a flailed newt."

There once was a Leprechaun fascinated by insects, which he caged and
kept as pets.  There were hundreds of the cages throughout his home,
each containing a single insect.  As it happened one day, he had
forgotten to close his window while cleaning the cage of one of the
smaller insects, and it escaped.

The little bug was enjoying it's new found capability of unhindered
flight when it chanced upon a gnome, who recognized it as his friend's
pet.  "Are you on your way home, little one?" the gnome asked.  And
the insect replied "No, I'm a freed gnat."

Once upon a time, when I was training to be a mathematician, a group of
us bright young students taking number theory discovered the names of
the smaller prime numbers.
2:  The Odd Prime --
        It's the only even prime, therefore is odd.  QED.
3:  The True Prime --
        Lewis Carroll: "If I tell you three times, it's true."
31: The Arbitrary Prime --
        Determined by unanimous unvote.  We needed an arbitrary prime
        in case the prof asked for one, and so had an election.  91
        received the most votes (well, it *looks* prime) and 3+4i the
        next most.  However, 31 was the only candidate to receive none
        at all.
Since the composite numbers are formed from primes, their qualities are
derived from those primes.  So, for instance, the number 6 is "odd but
true", while the powers of 2 are all extremely odd numbers.

All the numbers went to a party and numbers being what they are, all

neither group interacted with eachother. Whilst two was chatting to
four he noticed zero was on his own in the corner and suggested to
four that because zero is sort of even he should be encouraged to mix
with even numbers - four agreed. So off went two to invite zero into
their little group. "Would you like to join our little group" enquired
two, to which zero replied "I have nothing to add!"

                  Top ten reasons why e is inferior to pi

10) e is less challenging to spell than pi.
9) e ~=2.718281828459045, which can be easily memorized to its billionth place,
whereas pi needs "skills" to be memorized.
8) The character for e is so cheap that it can be found on a keyboard. But pi is
special (it's under "special symbols" in word processor programs.)
7) Pi is the bigger piece of pie.
6) e has an easy limit definition and infinite series. The limit definition of
pi and the infinite series are much harder.
5) e you understand what it is even though you start learning it late when
you're in pre-calculus. But pi, even after five or six years it's still hard to
know what it really is.
4) People mistakenly confuse Euler's Number (e) with Euler's Constant (gamma).
There is no confusion with the one and only pi
3) e is named after a person, but pi stands for itself.
2) Pi is much shorter and easier to say than "Euler's Number".
1) To read pi, you don't have to know that Euler's name is really pronounced
Oiler.

One day he met a new patient; and true to form he stared at him and
said "I differentiate you!", but for once, his victim's  expression
didn't change.  Surprised, the mathematician marshalled his energies,
stared fiercely at the new patient and said loudly "I differentiate
you!", but still the other man had no reaction.  Finally, in
frustration, the mathematician screamed out "I DIFFERENTIATE YOU!" --

          	Better Living Through Group Theory

 			by Peter Turner

An extremely poorly prepared talk on the role of group theory in
physics.  It will begin with some mathematical jargon in order to
discourage anyone from asking questions, and conclude with hastily
prepared examples from a vast number of physical disciplines--that number
being approximately equal to three.  All are welcome to offer examples
from their own research in order to increase both that number as well as
the amount of time I am drinking and not talking.

Spell Checked and reformatted by Nathan Mates (nathan@cco.caltech.edu)
As scientists and concerned citizens, we applaud the recent trend towards
legislation which requires the prominent placing of warnings on products
that present hazards to the general public. Yet we must also offer the
cautionary thought that such warnings, however well-intentioned, merely
scratch the surface of what is really necessary in this important area.
This is especially true in light of the findings of 20th century physics.

We are therefore proposing that, as responsible scientists, we join
together in an intensive push for new laws that will mandate the
conspicuous placement of suitably informative warnings on the packaging of
every product offered for sale in the United States of America. Our
suggested list of warnings appears below.

WARNING: This Product Warps Space and Time in Its Vicinity.

WARNING: This Product Attracts Every Other Piece of Matter in the Universe,
Including the Products of Other Manufacturers, with a Force Proportional to
the Product of the Masses and Inversely Proportional to the Distance Between
Them.

CAUTION: The Mass of This Product Contains the Energy Equivalent of 85 Million
Tons of TNT per Net Ounce of Weight.

HANDLE WITH EXTREME CARE: This Product Contains Minute Electrically Charged
Particles Moving at Velocities in Excess of Five Hundred Million Miles Per
Hour.

CONSUMER NOTICE: Because of the "Uncertainty Principle," It Is Impossible
for the Consumer to Find Out at the Same Time Both Precisely Where This
Product Is and How Fast It Is Moving. (Note: This one is optional on the
grounds that Heisenburg was never quite sure that his principle was
correct)

ADVISORY: There is an Extremely Small but Nonzero Chance That, Through a
Process Know as "Tunneling," This Product May Spontaneously Disappear from
Its Present Location and Reappear at Any Random Place in the Universe,
Including Your Neighbor's Domicile. The Manufacturer Will Not Be Responsible
for Any Damages or Inconvenience That May Result.

READ THIS BEFORE OPENING PACKAGE: According to Certain Suggested Versions of
the Grand Unified Theory, the Primary Particles Constituting this Product May
Decay to Nothingness Within the Next Four Hundred Million Years.

THIS IS A 100% MATTER PRODUCT: In the Unlikely Event That This Merchandise
Should Contact Antimatter in Any Form, a Catastrophic Explosion Will Result.

PUBLIC NOTICE AS REQUIRED BY LAW: Any Use of This Product, in Any Manner
Whatsoever, Will Increase the Amount of Disorder in the Universe. Although No
Liability Is Implied Herein, the Consumer Is Warned That This Process Will
Ultimately Lead to the Heat Death of the Universe.

NOTE: The Most Fundamental Particles in This Product Are Held Together by a
"Gluing" Force About Which Little is Currently Known and Whose Adhesive Power
Can Therefore Not Be Permanently Guaranteed.

ATTENTION: Despite Any Other Listing of Product Contents Found Hereon, the
Consumer is Advised That, in Actuality, This Product Consists Of
99.9999999999% Empty Space.

NEW GRAND UNIFIED THEORY DISCLAIMER: The Manufacturer May Technically Be
Entitled to Claim That This Product Is Ten-Dimensional. However, the Consumer
Is Reminded That This Confers No Legal Rights Above and Beyond Those
Applicable to Three-Dimensional Objects, Since the Seven New Dimensions Are
"Rolled Up" into Such a Small "Area" That They Cannot Be Detected.

PLEASE NOTE: Some Quantum Physics Theories Suggest That When the Consumer Is
Not Directly Observing This Product, It May Cease to Exist or Will Exist Only
in a Vague and Undetermined State.

COMPONENT EQUIVALENCY NOTICE: The Subatomic Particles (Electrons, Protons,
etc.) Comprising This Product Are Exactly the Same in Every Measurable
Respect as Those Used in the Products of Other Manufacturers, and No Claim
to the Contrary May Legitimately Be Expressed or Implied.

HEALTH WARNING: Care Should Be Taken When Lifting This Product, Since Its
Mass, and Thus Its Weight, Is Dependent on Its Velocity Relative to the
User.

IMPORTANT NOTICE TO PURCHASERS: The Entire Physical Universe, Including
This Product, May One Day Collapse Back into an Infinitesimally Small
Space. Should Another Universe Subsequently Re-emerge, the Existence of
This Product in That Universe Cannot Be Guaranteed.

                                Cold Fusion
Let me tell you a story.

When I was a senior (UG) at the University of Houston, I had a class with
Ernest Henley.  Ernest and John Seader collaborated on the text which dealt
with simulation of separations.

When P & F announced their findings, Henley made a point of contacint John
(head of the CHE department at Utah.)

John told him that P & F, among others,  had been working on CF for years.
P&F had been fired from Utah but had been brought back on.

"So why the suuport - all of a sudden?" Henley asked.

According to Henley, P&F left their experiment on one weekend on the fourth
floor of a building only to find it in the basement on Monday.  (It melted
thru 4 concerete floors.)

Believe it if you need it but believe it if you will.

Its the God honests truth.

From:   Richard Schultz <schultr@gefen.cc.biu.ac.il>

I (alone of the s.p.f. regulars, AFAIK) was actually at the University
of Utah Department of Chemistry in 1989 (and in fact attended P&F's
first press conference).  Jim Carr is right -- it's just a story.

: >John told him that P & F, among others,  had been working on CF for years.
: >P&F had been fired from Utah but had been brought back on.

Fleischmann was never a faculty member at Utah.  He was considered "adjunct"
but AFAIK did not even have an office at Utah -- his home base was in
England.  Pons was not fired (it's tough to fire someone with tenure).
The semester after the big announcement, Pons did not show up to teach
his class, and sent a fax explaining that he was on leave.  Not teaching
your classes is just about the only thing you *can* be fired for, but
the department allowed him a graceful way out by making him a "research"
professor and (IIRC) eventually accepting his resignation.

By the way, the head of the department at the time was John Simons, but
he is universally known as "Jack" Simons.

:> According to Henley, P&F left their experiment on one weekend on the
:> fourth floor of a building only to find it in the basement on Monday.
:> (It melted thru 4 concerete floors.)

This is completely untrue.  Pons's laboratory was *in* the basement.
And I worked on the third floor of that same building -- I think I would
have noticed holes in the floor and ceiling.  What happened was that
they left an apparatus over the weekend and found on Monday that it had
destroyed itself in some kind of violent fashion.  Other than scorch marks,
however, the fume hood in which the experiment had been sitting was still
in good shape.  The obvious explanation, one that fit all of the facts, was
that there was a hydrogen fire.  They preferred to believe that they had
had a CF "meltdown."  They believed it so much that they didn't even
bother testing for residual radiation before going back to work.

A Princeton plasma physicist is at the beach when he discovers a ancient

physicist retrieves a map of the world from his car an circles the Middle
East and tells the genie, "I wish you to bring peace in this region".

After 10 long minutes of deliberation, the genie replies, "Gee, there are
lots of problems there with Lebanon, Iraq, Israel, and all those other
places. This is awfully embarrassing. I've never had to do this before, but
I'm just going to have to ask you for another wish. This one is just too

tokamak would achieve scientific fusion energy break-even."

After another deliberation the genie asks, "Could I see that map again?"

Editors (=my) note:
This is a classical joke that appeared in "Die Naturwissenschaften"
somewhere in the 30's. Eddington numerology was hip, and the Editor
must have slept, so this stuff went through. In the next issue the
sour-faced retraction followed. I have freely translated the stuff,
luckily the central pun carries over unharmed.

"This is an attempt to explain the value of the absolute zero
temperature. To reach it, all degrees of freedom must be frozen.
Now, due to Eddington, proton and electron have both 1/alpha degrees
of freedom. But even at absolute zero, their circulating around
each other can't stop. Summing up, this means absolute zero is at
minus (2/alpha-1) degrees. With a value of 1/alpha=137.08, this makes
-273.16 degrees, which is surprisingly close to the known value."

Furgeson and the Unified Field Theory

In the beginning there was Aristotle
And objects at rest tended to remain at rest
And objects in motion tended to come to rest
And God saw that it was boring, although very restful.

Then God created Newton
And objects at rest tended to remain at rest
And objects in motion tended to remain in motion
And energy was conserved, and momentum was conserved,
And matter was conserved
And God saw that it was conservative.

Then God created Einstein
And everything was relative
And fast things became short
And straight things became curved
And the universe was filled with inertial frames
And God saw that it was relatively general
but some of it was especially relative.

Then God created Bohr
And there was the principle
And the principle was quantum
And all things were quantified
But some things were still relative
And God saw that it was confusing.

Then God was going to create Furgeson
And Furgeson would have unified
And he would have fielded a theory
And all would have been one.
But it was the seventh day
And God rested
And objects at rest tend to remain at rest.

           HUMATRANS - A TRANSPORTATION DEVICE FOR HOMO SAPIENS

This is an original article by me and M.S.Moni, my colleague
when I was a graduate student in India.  I have slightly edited
the text, but most of it is intact.   Moni is still at IIT and
has no objection to the dissemination of this article.

There is some interesting background story, but I will leave it
out, unless someone wants to know.
------------------------------------------------------------------

                                 HUMATRANS

         (A Transportation Device for Homo Sapiens)

                Dinesh Nettar- and M.S.Moni=
       Regional Sophisticated Instrumentation Centre,
              Indian Institute of Technology,
                   Madras 600 036, India

                          Abstract

          This device principally operates on the
          transmission of mechanical energy delivered
          from the payload to circular rotators that
          enable positive displacement of the operating
          system.  The linear motion of the payload
          energy source is converted to circular motion
          in the device.

1.  COMPONENTS AND OPERATION

1.1  FRAMEWORK

The device is built around a triangular framework, to ensure
structural stability[1].  Its tubular construction enables
reduced gravitational load[2] without sacrificing mechanical
integrity.  All the remaining components are mounted on this
structure.

1.2  BRANCHED COUPLERS

On this framework, two rotators are mounted through a pair of
branched couplers.  The aft coupler is linear, while the forward
coupler is semi-parabolic[3].  Its non-radial orientation ensures
automatic return to default theta setting on normal operating
surfaces.  Its non-linearity provides partial attenuation of low

                           - 2 -

frequency oscillations.  The forward coupler is coincident with
the theta control.

1.3  ROTATORS

Each of the rotators has a cylindrical axial support at which
place the coupler is joined.  The grooved peripheral structure is
connected to the axial support by a set of pre-stressed off-
radial connectors.  These connectors ensure relatively evenly
distributed load.  The peripheral structure carries an annular
cover made of isoprene polymer duly processed with sulfur.  The
interstice between the cover and the peripheral structure is
charged with a gaseous mixture of nitrogen, oxygen and other rare
gases[4].  The gas mixture is prevented from leakage by a gas
retainer.

1.4  GROOVED LAMINAS

Semi-circular grooved laminas are mounted in proximity to both
rotators.  These prevent a slurry of SiO2, Fe2O3 and H2O from
contaminating the energy source and operator from the operating
surface.  These usually terminate in isoprene polymer extenders.

1.5  DECELERATION CONTROL

In operation, the rotators can be rapidly decelerated in the case
of necessity.  This is accomplished by depressing either or both
the deceleration control bars on the theta control.  These apply
instantaneous large mechanical loads on the rotators by
depressing isoprene polymer pads on the grooved peripheral
devices.

1.6  ENERGY RECEIVERS AND TRANSMITTERS

The aft rotator carries several circular energy receivers.  These
receivers have finite discontinuities on their circumference.
The receivers are ordered in increasing radii.  Each is
concentric with the aft axial support.  A discrete endless
coupled energy transfer device connects any one of these
receivers to one of the two energy transmitters of similar
structure.  These energy transmitter devices are mounted at the
lower apex of the main triangular framework.  The transmitters
can be set in motion by imparting angular momentum via an
orthogonal radial shaft.  This shaft carries a perpendicular
extension.  The planarity of the extension is necessitated for
positioning the operator's energy output source.  This extension
is pivoted to eliminate torsion of the energy source.

                           - 3 -

1.7  DECOUPLING MECHANISM

There is an ingeneous decoupling mechanism in the energy transfer
device.  While positive angular momenta are transferred from the
energy transmitter to the receiver, the positive angular momenta
of the receiver are not transmitted to the transmitter.  This
permits the energy source to be stressless during gravitationally
favorable transportation environments.

1.8  THETA CONTROL

Orientation mobility is ensured by a theta control.  This is
connected to the forward rotator coupler.  This has a short arm
symmetrically orthogonal to its main axis.  It can be used to set
theta from  -pi/2 to pi/2 radians continuously and it defaults to
zero on normal operating surfaces.  The theta control usually
carries additional controls that select combinations of the
energy transmitters and receivers.  These selections enable
nearly continuous variation of angular momentum ratios between
the energy source and the rotators.

1.9  POLYMER BASE

A polymer base is securely mounted at the rear apex of the
triangular framework.  This supports the operator during
operation.  It is usually buffered by metallic helices[5] to
minimize the transmission of low frequency oscillations from the
operating surface to the operator.

2.  ACCESSORIES (Only on some models)

2.1  ENERGY CONVERSION DEVICE

An energy conversion device is used to convert mechanical energy
into electrical energy by electromechanical induction[6].  The
electrical flux generates a stream of photons by resistance[7]
flow through a conductor enclosed in vacuum[8].  The photon
stream enables optical feedback to improve when the ambient
radiation characteristics are below optimum.

2.2  AUDIO-FREQUENCY SYNTHESIZER

An audio-frequency synthesizer for generating approach signals is
used to transmit early warning messages to surrounding areas to
avert a possible momentum transfer.

                           - 4 -

2.3  EXTRA PAYLOAD SUPPORT

Extra payload can be transported by a support device.  This is
mounted vertically above the aft rotator and is connected to the
aft axial coupler.

3.  GENERAL REMARKS

The device is ecologically excellent since it is totally non-
contaminating.  It is relatively very inexpensive, very easy to
maintain[9] and often portable.  Its reduced width requirements
and height make it ideal for almost any kind of operating
surface.  It also provides much-needed muscular training to the
users, besides agreeable diversement.

However, it is not self-propelled and so tends to deplete the
energy source during prolonged operations.  It is a low-priority
device on most operating surfaces since it does not reach high
linear velocities.  Due to its reduced gravitational stability,
the operator must be cautious not to provide a cushion[10] for
the internal combustion driven devices.

It cannot be computerized.

Plus th' usual wahr an' stuff, as requahred.

How d'ya do it, Joe?

Wal, ya find a ol' shack on a hill somewheres that still got pahr goin'
to it. (Elsewise, ya gots ta use a whole lotta ol' truck
batt'ries, which is tuff ta hump around.) Put th' crock in th' shack,
and pour th' Jolt water inta it. Stir in th' Lithium Lye, slow
an' careful. Don't splash none, an' don't add th' stuff too quick, now.
Cover it real taht, so's ya don't lose too much. Y'all
don't wanna hafta sneak inta th' navybase again, do ya? Them guys got
guns & stuff and they ain't afraid ta use it.

So, ennyway, see, ya bild the pahr splah, an' ya bild th' currint
reggalater in figger 3 at th' end of th' chapter, the one with
the special shunt cirkit fer changin' the currint. Thet's whar th'
Kickass tahmer goes. Test it ta be sure that th' current starts
at about 30 amps and goes down ta 10 or 15 when th' tahmer goes off.

Bild th' other stuff lahk in figger 2. Cart th' whole mess down ta th'
shack, and put th' bizniz end inta the Jolt water. Don't
leave th' lid off too long, now. Cover it up good, an' duck tape it,
specially th' place wher the wahrs come out. Ah got me
some motorcycle ground strap, which is read'ly avail'ble an' flat, so it
don't queer up the fit o' the lid. Bolt the straps down
real secure, an' put vaseline on th' bolts.

Now, set th' Kickass tahmer fer 8 weeks, plug th' pahr splah in, make
sure ya got 30 amps, an' take a hike.

'Member, neutrons ain't yer frens. Keep ol' Blue away from th' shack
unless ya want two-headed puppies runnin' around
eatin' too much, probly worrit yore mom no end, an' if ya gotta go in
ther ta check, don't stay long. Ya want ol' Joe's
advice, after around 7 weeks, don't go in ther atall.

This hear makes a real 'hot flash', an' in fact, it's whut this book is
named fer. Y'all kin see th' flash from a couple mahls
away, raht through th' av'ridge wall, so don't go bildin' it in yer

want yer sister fahndin' out wher her earrin's got off ta. She
probly woont lahk it, an' she'll make ya cut her in on the deal.
'Course, thet maht not be too bad, if she's good with a

Subject: Physics Exam Answer

I am a research and teaching assistant at the Swiss Federal Institute of
Technology in Zurich, Switzerland. Just recently, we corrected the written
exams of about 160 first-year physics students. One of the exam problems
consisted in calculating the length of a bungee cord so that the jumper
would just touch the water at the foot of the tower, given the height
of the platform, the jumper's mass and the strength of the cord.

The answer of one of the students started with the following sentence:
"For simplicity, I will neglect gravity in this problem."

              Warning: Wind energy facilities are radioactive

Wind energy is an oft touted "environmentally friendly" energy source.
Rarely is it mentioned that all of the components of a wind turbine are
radioactive. Radioactive isotopes in the building materials of wind energy
facilities include the following:

Rubidium 87
Potassium 40
Thorium 232, 230, 238, 227
Uranium 238, 235, 233
Radium 226, 228
Protactinium 231
Actinium 227
Astatine 215, 216, 218, 219
Bismuth 210, 211, 212, 214, 215
Francium 223
Lead 211, 212, 214
Polonium 210, 211, 212, 214, 215, 216, 218
Radon 219, 220, 222
Thalium 206, 207, 208, 210

When wind energy facilities are mothballed at high cost, the radioactive
nature of the materials is not accounted for. Some of the materials are
uried under slight amounts of soil, or simply left out in the open.

terms of equations".
15.	10 points for arguing that a current well-established theory is "only a

theory which he or she publicly supported. (E.g., that Feynman was a closet
opponent of special relativity, as deduced by reading between the lines in his
freshman physics textbooks.)

"conspiracy" to prevent your work from gaining its well-deserved fame, or
suchlike.
30.	40 points for comparing yourself to Galileo, suggesting that a modern-day
Inquisition is hard at work on your case, and so on.
31.	40 points for claiming that when your theory is finally appreciated,
present-day science will be seen for the sham it truly is. (30 more points for
fantasizing about show trials in which scientists who mocked your theories will
be forced to recant.)

From: Don Casada <doncasada@icx.net>
Here's a bit of poetry (using the term loosely) on Bernoulli's equation and
other fluid movement relations:

The way the water wends
(Words wrought by a worn down wag)

It's twice the rate at which rain doth fall
Into how fast it's a-gittin' there, square.

Plus what it is a holdin' it back times
Deux points trois ( l'eau sanitaire).

And how far thou art toward heaven
(or toward hell  better not go there!).

Now, I ain't the one who made this up,
But I do believe it's true.
And if you want to check it out,
Right here is what you do:

Talk with them fellers, Leon and Dan'l
(They's the ones who told it to me).
Though, strange, when I asked them who they wuz,
They said "Oil her" and "Burn you, Lee!"

Winding along the worrisome way,
Things heat up, and so I guess
You better not forget to
Account for shear distress.

My palpitatin' heart is a-pumpin',
It's plumb positively displaced!
And those heady words, "Energy o'er weight,"
My feeble mind just can't erase.

I'm feeling hot, tired and hammered,
Need a cool shower, I would say.
Ain't got no indoor plumbin' here,
But I figgered me another way...

Got eleven sixty gallon water barrels;
The old horse can lift 'em six feet,
And wash me down in just a minute,
That'll be perfect and complete!

Came across this at school, early 1950s.  Funny how some things stick!

                        ARCHIMEDES' PRINCIPLE

Students of physics are frequently told
Of experiments performed by great physicists of old
Like Boyles and Charles -- but greatest of these
Was the Principle discovered by Archimedes.

The Sicilian King, Archimedes was told,
Ordered a crown from a large lump of gold,
And though the weight of the gold was completely correct,
The goldsmith's eye made the King suspect
That he'd made up the weight with some cheaper metal
And stolen some gold, that his debts he might settle.
His problem was then of outstanding immensity
As he had no idea, whatsoever, of density.

Climbing into a bath he received a surprise
When he noticed the water beginning to rise.
He suddenly snapped, and let out a scream,
As he realised, with joy, his long-wished-for dream.

He found the upthrust, produced on a body's base*,
To be equal in weight to the water displaced,
And soon volumes and weights would make it quite plain
What various metals the crown could contain,
And so he could easily show to his Royalty
The absolute proof of the goldsmith's disloyalty.

Leaping out of the bath at remarkable rate,
He made for the palace by doorway and gate --
But the men in the street were completely confounded
To see a naked man shout "Eureka!  I've found it!"

*    Is this the only error?  The upthrust is not on the base, but at the
Centre of Pressure.

For tradition I have great respect,
And Sod's Law I'd never suspect
But you can be tricked,
When these two conflict:
Which one can you say is correct?

Now a cat always lands on its feet,
So tradition says.  And I repeat
Toast, when golden brown,
Lands butter side down,
Or Professor's Sod's law will be beat.

I needed to find the truth,
So I took the cat up to the roof -
All fourteen floors,
Though it scratched with its claws
And bit, but I must have the proof.

To its back strapped I one slice of bread,
With butter 'twas liberally spread;
In the interests of science,
Despite his defiance,
To the parapet's edge I did tread.

I tossed the cat over the rail;
It spat, yowled, and gave me one bale-
ful glare as it fell,
It wished me in hell...
But that's not the end of my tail.

A truck passing by in the street,
It's load covered by canvas sheet,
By the moggie was caught,
And it gallantly fought,
To cling to the side with its feet.

So now with my news I've regaled
You, but my schemings all failed.
I've still no evidence
Of which law takes precedence,
And probably soon I'll be jailed.

Tiddy Ogg.

Sod's Law, in case anyone does not know states: if it can go wrong, it
will.
This was discovered by Britain's Professor Sod, but, like so many
other things, the Merkins claim credit for their Dr. Murphy.

Of toast I soon had had my fill

Rill's suspended - spinning there still!

Archie - All I have to do now is to attach a system of shafts and cogs
and - whoopee - a perpetual motion machine!!!!
For newcomers - cats always land on their feet, Toast always lands
butter side down.   Sod discovered this and Murphy replicated the
experiments, thus confirming them!

Einsteinium
by Susan Lowe

Radio-active Einsteinium
Has the atomic number nine-ninium.
It was found in the ash
Of a hydrogen blast.
As is its chemical signium.
So few really know of Einsteinium,
It really is one of a kindium.
It doesn't seem fair
To have to compare,
It just doesn't have any timium.

A corpuscle once did oscillate so quickly to and fro,
He always raised disturbances wherever he did go.
He struggles hard for freedom against a powerful foe --
An atom -- who would not let him go.
The aether trembled at his agitations
   In a manner so familiar that I only need to say,
In accordance with Clerk Maxwell's six equations,
   It tickled people's optics far away.


The corpuscle radiated until he had conceived
A plan by which his freedom might easily be achieved;
I'll not go into details for I might not be believed,
Indeed, I'm sure I should not be believed.
However, there was one decisive action.
   The atom and the corpuscle each made a single charge,
But the atom could not hold him in subjection,
   Though something like a thousand times as large.


   The corpuscle won the day,
   And in freedom went away,
   And became a cathode ray.
   But his life was rather gay,
   And he went at such a rate
   That he ran against a plate;
   When the aether saw his fate
   Its pulse did palpitate.

                  THE QUANTUM'S PLIGHT

A lively little quantum went darting through the air,
Just as energetic quanta go speeding everywhere.
He had traveled far -- this quantum -- urged as if by some far
call,
When he saw a lonely atom with no signs of pep at all,
And he started for that atom in the highest of elation,
Said he: "Here's where I show the world a trick of transmutation.
I'm going to hit that atom such an awful, awful whack,
That I'll knock out its electrons so far they can't get back."
So he gave that peaceful atom such an energetic shove,
That its outermost electrons soared to levels far above.
Then the atom got excited, and it held the quantum fast,
Until the last electron came tumbling back at last.
Then the quantum was released again, and fled in degradation,
While the atom got the credit for a lot of radiation.

A Brief History of Gravity
by Bruce Elliot

It filled Galileo with mirth
To watch his two rocks fall to Earth.
He gladly proclaimed,
"Their rates are the same,
And quite independent of girth!"

Then Newton announced in due course
His own law of gravity's force:
"It goes, I declare,
As the inverted square
Of the distance from object to source."

But remarkably, Einstein's equation
Succeeds to describe gravitation
As spacetime that's curved,
And it's this that will serve
As the planets' unique motivation.

By a new way of thinking we're smitten.

                        The Orphan Entity

The entity, we'll call it S, differed in every way.
While some spun left and some spun right, S would merely stay.
S was neither left nor right nor up nor down, but rather in the middle.
Lacking color and charm and other traits that made its neighbors notable,
S resolved to leave this place and find a spot more suitable.
A quiet place that a colorless, measureless waif would find hospitable.
A spot where an entity without mass, or motion,
would not be likely to cause commotion.
After giving much thought to the matter, and energy too,
S arrived at a solution which it felt would do.
"Empty space is just the place for an orphan entity to spend
                                                  infinity," S thought.
Alas, although the universe is far and wide, there is no empty space inside.
So S went beyond into a black void and found.... nothing.
"Perfect," it said, "but let there be light."

A violation of Sir Isaac was found
By Megan hurtling fast toward the ground
She's not in smithereens
Because on trampolines
What goes down, must go up, then go down.

Can be rewritten into limerick form, saving the excellent last
line (with a minor violation in the lack of true rhyme), as:

The laws of Sir Isaac were found
To bring Megan so fast toward the ground
Yet she's not smithereens
Since on all trampolines
What goes down, must go up, then go down.

The "Novel soliton solutions in Rowland ghost gaps" is far from a

                              The Galaxy Song

Just remember that you're standing on a planet that's evolving
And revolving at 900 miles an hour.
It's orbiting at 19 miles a second, so it's reckoned,
The sun that is the source of all our power.
Now the sun, and you and me, and all the stars that we can see,
Are moving at a million miles a day,
In the outer spiral arm, at 40,000 miles an hour,
Of a galaxy we call the Milky Way.

Our galaxy itself contains a hundred billion stars;
It's a hundred thousand light-years side to side;
It bulges in the middle sixteen thousand light-years thick,
But out by us it's just three thousand light-years wide.
We're thirty thousand light-years from Galactic Central Point,
We go 'round every two hundred million years;
And our galaxy itself is one of millions of billions
In this amazing and expanding universe.

Our universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding,
In all of the directions it can whiz;
As fast as it can go, at the speed of light, you know,
Twelve million miles a minute and that's the fastest speed there is.
So remember, when you're feeling very small and insecure,
How amazingly unlikely is your birth;
And pray that there's intelligent life somewhere out in space,
'Cause there's bugger all down here on Earth!

  The Einstein and the Eddington

The sun was setting on the links,
The moon looked down serene,
The caddies all had gone to bed,
But still there could be seen
Two players lingering by the trap
That guards the thirteenth green.

The Einstein and the Eddington
Were counting up their score;
The Einstein's card showed ninety-eight
And Eddington's was more.
And both lay bunkered in the trap
And both stood there and swore.

I hate to see, the Einstein said;
Such quantities of sand;
Just why they placed a bunker here
I cannot understand.
If one could smooth this landscape out,
I think it would be grand.

If seven maids with seven mops
Would sweep the fairway clean
I'm sure that I could make this hole
In less than seventeen.
I doubt it, said the Eddington,
Your slice is pretty mean.

Then all the little golf balls came
To see what they were at,
And some of them were tall and thin
And some were short and fat,
A few of them were round and smooth,
But most of them were flat.

The time has come, said Eddington,
To talk of many things:
Of cubes and clocks and meter-sticks
And why a pendulum swings.
And how far space is out of plumb,
And whether time has wings.

I learned at school the apple's fall
To gravity was due,
But now you tell me that the cause
Is merely G_mu-nu,
I cannot bring myself to think
That this is really true.

You say that gravitation's force
Is clearly not a pull.
That space is mostly emptiness,
While time is nearly full;
And though I hate to doubt your word,
It sounds like a bit of bull.

And space, it has dimensions four,
Instead of only three.
The square of the hypotenuse
Ain't what it used to be.
It grieves me sore, the things you've done
To plane geometry.

You hold that time is badly warped,
That even light is bent:
I think I get the idea there,
If this is what you meant:
The mail the postman brings today,
Tomorrow will be sent.

If I should go Timbuctoo
With twice the speed of light,
And leave this afternoon at four,
I'd get back home last night.
You've got it now, the Einstein said,
That is precisely right.

But if the planet Mercury
In going round the sun,
Never returns to where it was
Until its course is run,
The things we started out to do
Were better not begun.

And if before the past is through,
The future intervenes;
Then what's the use of anything;
Of cabbages or queens?
Pray tell me what's the bally use
Of Presidents and Deans.

The shortest line, Einstein replied,
Is not the one that's straight;
It curves around upon itself,
Much like a figure eight,
And if you go too rapidly
You will arrive too late.

But Easter day is Christmas time
And far away is near,
And two and two is more than four
And over there is here.
You may be right, said Eddington,
It seems a trifle queer.

But thank you very, very much,
For troubling to explain;
I hope you will forgive my tears,
My head begins to pain;
I feel the symptoms coming on
Of softening of the brain.

(This is one of Greg's favorite poems, for obvious reasons. He thinks it
was probably first published in Physics Today sometime between 1987 and
1991, but since he is unable to find the proper issue...oh well.)

I've studied all the sciences in order alphabetical,
My judgment is, which some of you may find to be heretical,
        The field that's really quite abstruse,
        The field where all the screws come loose,
The field that's famous for its spoofs, is physics theoretical.

I've taken undergraduate work whose content is forgettable;
And graduate work is gen'rally regarded as regrettable.
        The lecturers are all absurd.
        A cogent word is never heard.
Insanity afflicts a third in physics theoretical.

We never do experiments; we shun the purely practical.
Our best work's done in getting grants--our budgets are fantastical.
        In one respect our motive's pure:
        Though funding fails, we still endure--
We make damn sure our job's secure in physics theoretical.

Our scientific breakthroughs are, to say the least, debatable.
We laugh at critics haughtily; our egos are inflatable.
        The rest of science goes along,
        Because our last defense is strong:
It's hard to prove we're ever wrong in physics theoretical.

I wrote the first of these, about Newton's laws, during an electricity and
magnetism lab in which we were attempting to get a scanning tunneling electron
microscope to a) funtion and b) transfer the images it created to a normal
format. Neither happened. We think the problem was in the tip, and didn't feel
like waiting the extra week or two to etch a tip using acid. That's probably
because we spent the first half of the course trying to get an Auger apparatus
to work. It didn't. It wasn't our fault. Cursed machines.

I don't suppose you happen to know
Why the sky is blue? It's because the snow
Takes out the white. That leaves it clean
For the trees and grass to take out the green.
Then pears and bananas start to mellow,
And bit by bit they take out the yellow.
The sunsets, of course, take out the red
And pour it into the ocean bed
Or behind the mountains in the west.
You take all that out and the rest
Couldn't be anything else but blue.
Look for yourself. You can see it's true.

                   LIMERICK CONTEST FINALISTS & WINNERS

A total of 190 limericks were received since the contest was announced in
the December issue of APS News. Although most entrants sent in one or two
limericks, one sent in 22 and a 'team' from Harvard sent a record
37. Schr"dinger's cat, which was the favorite subject, has reason to feel
paranoid; reviewers for Phys Rev came in a close second. The longest poem,
a finalist, had 13 limerick-form stanzas.

A note on the selection process: The editor collected opinions from members
of the March and April meeting program committees, APS visitors and staff
members. They had diverse tastes, to say the least, and many limericks not
included among the finalists below had ardent admirers. The final selection
was mine (as is the blame for most of the titles). Some are acknowledged
'groaners' - but punsters have to live too; some don't scan so well, but
had other redeeming qualities. As promised, each author will receive a
dunking bird; the winners will receive a flock (3). Most submissions
(except for a few) may be viewed on the APS website at:
http://www.aps.org/apsnews/limericks.html. Enjoy.

       A Brief History of Gravity
            by Bruce Elliot

It filled Galileo with mirth
To watch his two rocks fall to Earth.
He gladly proclaimed,
"Their rates are the same,
And quite independent of girth!"

Then Newton announced in due course
His own law of gravity's force:
"It goes, I declare,
As the inverted square
Of the distance from object to source."

But remarkably, Einstein's equation
Succeeds to describe gravitation
As spacetime that's curved,
And it's this that will serve
As the planets' unique motivation.

Yet the end of the story's not written;
By a new way of thinking we're smitten.
We twist and we turn,
Attempting to learn
The Superstring Theory of Witten!

  Limerico di Galileo© [13 stanzas]
          by Martin J. Murphy

While watching a cannonball's motion,
Galileo conceived of the notion
That natural laws,
Not a mystical Cause,
Ruled the physical world's locomotion.

Though its own view was mostly confused,
The Church was not greatly amused
With this flaunting of Deo
By old Galileo
And ordered it quickly defused.

So the Pope sent some priests who inquired
If it wouldn't be best he retired?
"Undoubtedly you know
What we did for Bruno;
Do you also wish to be fired?"

He asked an old Cardina;'s opinion:
"Pray tell me, Your Grace, if you will then,
Does this mean what I think?
That henceforth I must shrink
From discussing my clever perception?"

Said Bellarmine, "No, it is not a ban;
If you want to keep teaching of course you can.
They merely have said
To take care where you tread
And smile when you say thing Copernican."

Unbeknownst to our venerable dissident
The records said something quite different.
When the Pope saw the note
The inquisitors wrote
He lost what remained of his temperament.

The message the Vatican sent
Was blunt in its stated intent
"Recant all this heresy
Quick or we'll harass thee,
Now until your life has been spent."

In facing the dread inquisition,
Few men could defend their position;
So it shouldn't surprise
When we are apprised
Of old Galileo's decision.

"Explaining celestial motion
Needs more than just faith and devotion.
But to save my poor head
I'll recant what I've said
(Though I'll secretly keep to my notion)".

So our friend the illustrious Florentine
Spent his last years in Vatican quarantine,
Locked up in his home
By the prelates of Rome
For being a cosmical libertine.

The Church caused a major imbroglio
By correcting Copernicus' folio
Yet it couldn't discern
The abuse it would earn
In forbidding the whole Dialogo?

By killing Sidereus Nuncius
For the news that their views were defunctus,
The renaissance ended
And darkness descended
Upon the Dominican dunces.

In spite of the Vatican's dissuasion
Galileo still rose to the occasion.
Though once deemed heretical,
He proved more prophetical
Than those of a clerical persuasion.

            Cole's Lost Soul

Here is something I found that you should know about if you don't

Where can I find "real" literature discussing the same thing,
seeing as how this verse is apparently an effort to paraphrase something
someone studied in a real math and-or physics course, but I do not know
how to make sense of it.  Does anyone know who the Dr. Ball is, who is
mentioned in the last verse? If you know the answer to these questions,

Song of the Screw

A moving form or rigid mass,
Under whate'er conditions
Along successive screws must pass
Between each two positions.
It turns around and slides along--
This is the burden of my song.

The pitch of screw, if multiplied
     By angle of rotation,
Will give the distance it must glide
     In motion of translation.
Infinite pitch means pure translation,
And zero pitch means pure rotation.

Two motions on two given screws,
     With amplitudes at pleasure,
Into a third screw-motion fuse;
     Whose amplitude we measure
By parallelogram construction
(A very obvious deduction.)

Its axis cuts the nodal line
    Which to both screws is normal,
And generates a form divine,
    Whose name, in language formal,
Is "surface-ruled of third degree."
Cylindroid is the name for me.

Rotation round a given line
    Is like a force along.
If to say couple you incline,
    You're clearly in the wrong.
'T is obvious, upon reflection,
A line is not a mere direction.

So couples with translations too
     In all respects agree;
And thus there centres in the screw
     A wondrous harmony
Of Kinematics and of statics,--
The sweetest thing in mathematics.

The forces on one given screw,
     With motion on a second,
In general some work will do,
     Whose magnitude is reckoned
By angle, force and what we call
The coefficent virtual.

Rotation now to force convert,
     And force into rotation;
Unchanged the work, we can assert,
     In spite of transformation.
And if two screws no work can claim,
Reciprocal will be their name.

Five numbers will a screw define,
     A screwing motion, six;
For four will give the axial line,
     One more the pitch will fix;
And hence we always can contrive
One screw reciprocal to five.

Screws-- two, three, or four combined
     (No question here of six),
Yield other screws which are combined
     Within one screw complex.
Thus we obtain the clearest notion
Of freedom and constraint of motion.

In complex III., three several screws
     At every point you find,
Or if you one direction choose,
     One screw is to your mind;
And complexes of order III.
Their own reciprocals may be.

In IV., wherever you arrive,
     You find of screws a cone,
On every line in complex V.
     There is precisely one;
At each point of this complex rich,
A plane of screws have given pitch.

But time would fail me to discourse
     Of Order and Degree;
Of Impulse, Energy and Force,
     And Reciprocity.
All these and more, for motions small,
Have been discussed by Dr. Ball.

            Neutrinos
                  by John Updike

Neutrinos: they are very small
They have no charge; they have no mass;
they do not interact at all.
The Earth is just a silly ball
to them, through which they simply pass
like dustmaids down a drafty hall
or photons through a sheet of glass.
They snub the most exquisite gas,
ignore the most substantial wall,
cold shoulder steel and sounding brass,
insult the stallion in his stall,
and, scorning barriers of class,
infiltrate you and me. Like tall
and painless guillotines they fall
down through our heads into the grass.
At night, they enter at Nepal
and pierce the lover and his lass
from underneath the bed. You call
it wonderful; I call it crass.

"Whoe'er would search the starry sky,
  Its secrets to devine, sir,
Should take his glass - I mean, should try
  A glass or tow of wine, sir!
True virtue lies in golden mean,
  and man must wet his clay, sir;
Join these two maxims, and 'tis seen
  He should drink his bottle a day, sir!

"Old Archimedes, reverend sage!
  By trump of fame renowed, sir,
Deep problems solved in every page,
  And the sphere's curved surface found, sir:
Himself he would have far outshone,
  And borne a wider sway, sir,
Had he our modern secret known,
  And drank a bottle a day, sir!

"When Ptolemy, now long ago,
  Believed the earth stood still, sir,
He never would have blundered so,
  Had he but drunk his fill, sir.
He'd then have felt it circulate,
  And would have learnt to say, sir,
The true way to investigate
  Is to drink your bottle a day, sir!

"Copernicus, that learned wight,
  The glory of his nation,
With draughts of wine refreshed his sight,
  And saw the earths's rotation;
Each planet then its orb described,
  The moon got under way, sir;
These truths from nature he imbibed
  For he drank his bottle a day, sir!

"The noble Tycho placed the stars,
  Each in his due location;
He lost his nose(1) by spite of Mars,
  But that was no privation:
Had he but lost his mouth, I grant
  He would have felt dismay, sir,
Bless you! *he* knew what he should want
  To drink his bottle a day, sir!

"Cold water makes no lucky hits;
  On mysteries the head runs:
Small drink let Kepler time his wits
  On the regular polyhedrons:
He took to wine, and it changed the chime,
  His genius swept away, sir,
Through area varying at the time
  At the rate of a bottle a day, sir!

"Poor Galileo, forced to rat
  Before the inquisition,
*E pur si muove* was the pat
  He gave them in addition:
He meant, whate'er you think you prove,
  the earth must go its way, sirs;
Spite of your teeth I'll make it move
  For I'll drink my bottle a day, sirs!

"Great Newton, who was never beat
  Whatever fools may think, sir;
Though sometimes he forgot to eat,
  He never forgot to drink, sir;
Descartes(2) took nought but lemonade,
  To conquer him was play, sir;
The first advance that Newton made
  Was to drink his bottle a day, sir!

"D'Alembert, Euler and Clairaut,
  Though they increased our store, sir,
Much further had been seen to go
  Had they tippled a little more, sir!
Lagrange gets mellow with Laplace,
  And both are wont to say, sir!
The *philosophe* who's not an ass
  Will drink his bottle a day, sir!

"Astronomers! What can avail
  Those who calumniate us;
Experiment can never fail
  With such an apparatus:
Let him who'd have his merits known
  Remember what I say, sir;
Fair science shines on him alone
  Who drinks his bottle a day, sir!

"How light we reck of those who mock
  By this we'll make him appear,s ir,
We'll dine by the sidereal clock
  For one more bottle a year, sir:
But choose which pendulum you will, sir,
Unless you drink - and drink your fill, -
  At least a bottle a day, sir!"

fought in the dark, "in tenebris densis"; and it is a nice problem to shave

Adopting quote:
It is wrong to think that the task of physics is to find out how
Nature is. Physics concerns what we say about Nature.

physicist to the place where he understands the nature of physical problems
that he is already too old to solve them.

A physics professor at a state university in Michigan was famous for
his animated lectures. He was short and thin with wild white hair and
an excited expression. In lecture he would through himself from the
top of desks and throw frisbees to students in the back row to
illustrate various principles.

One day in class he was spinning on an office chair holding weights
in each hand when he lost his balance and tumbled into the first row.
He apologized to his class for going off on a tangent.

 Sir Isaac Newton had a theory of how to get the best outcomes in a
courtroom. He suggested to lawyers that they should drag their arguments
into the late afternoon hours. The English judges of his day would never
abandon their 4 o'clock tea time, and therefore would always bring down
their hammer and enter a hasty, positive decision so they could retire to
their chambers for a cup of Earl Grey.

 This tactic used by the British lawyers is still recalled as Newton's Law
of Gavel Tea. (By Guy Ben Moshe)

Two atoms were walking down the street. One turns to the other and says,
"Oh, no! I think I'm an ion!"
The other responds, "Are you sure?!?"
"Yes, I'm positive!"

From: Mountain Man <prfbrown@magna.com.au>
So the 2nd atom aks: "Quantum well - what are ya gunnadoo abootit?

and the 1st atom, after having a few, replies:

  "In principle, I am uncertain about getting charged,
   maybe its gone off on the great cosmic wave train,
   or eloped with a stray alpha particle.
   Maybe I'm just losing my attraction?
   Maybe I've taken one too many hits from the lab.
   Maybe I should just decay right here in this bar."

At that moment, a delightful little e- flies through the
aether of the inter-atomic realms and settles in a mutually
comfortable 1920's eigenstatechair near the virtuous pair,
and says to the two atoms:

   "Hope you guys are not molecular"

So the 1st atom perks up and says:

   "Naa: just been surfin' and think I lost an electron"

The 2nd atom finishes his drink and leaves, saying:

   "Gunna split. Gotta DNA contract this evenin'"

And as the sun sets slowly in the west, and the crescent moon
rises only just a little faster over the eastern ridges of
the atomic horizon, the atom and the electron take a stroll
under the emergent stars, and know with a growing certaintly
that they are not just some loose charges looking for a little
physical action, but in fact the beginning of a newly created
completeness in the midst of the cosmic harmony - if only for
a picosecond.

Years ago, when I lived in Topanga, California (near LA) I had a magnetic
sign on my car saying REPEAL OHM'S LAW with my phone number. As a result I
received a number of interesting calls. One was from a physics professor at
UCLA. He said he was all in favor of repealing Ohm's Law, but requested
that I wait until the end of the quarter so he wouldn't have to rewrite his
lecture notes.

Allan wrote that he was "on the committee to revoke Ohm's Law". Let me
guess: Ohm's Law: is that the one about sitting crosslegged and chanting
"Ohm! Ohm! Ohm!" ?  Watt is Ohm's law and who volted it into existence? Has
it met with any resistance in its application? Please respond quickly

Ohm's Law was good enough in its time, but that time is past. It is a
rankly discriminatory piece of legislation and should be repealed or
severely amended. Current should be directly proportional to BOTH voltage
and resistance, or inversely proportional to both, or proportional to
neither.

However, he was under a lot of stress so he thought he would go on vacation
to Mexico.

life.  On the last night he was staying there he decided to take a walk along
the beach and watch the sunset.

        As he watched the sun go down he thought of the light of the sun and
then the speed of light.  You see, he had been using the speed of light in a
lot of his calculations but he didn't decided on what symbol to use for it.
Greek had been so overused.

        Just at that moment Senior Wensez was also walking along the beach in
the opposite direction.  Albert caught him out of the corner of his eye and
remarked suddenly, "Do you not zink zat zee speed of light is very fast?"

        Senior Wensez paused for a moment and replied, "Si."

The particle physicist was tired of his work - he'd been trying to discover
the loveton (the hypothetical particle that carries the force of attraction
between two people) and he was getting nowhere. `What I need,' he said to
himself,`is a good long holiday doing somthing completely different.'So he
went to his travel agent and got some holiday brochures and looked through
them, trying to decide what to do. Skiing in the Alps? No - too near CERN.
Scuba diving on the barrier reef? No - he'd forever be trying to calculate
the pressure he was under at any particular depth. At last, just as he was
about to give up and go back to his collider, he spotted a small ad in the
classified section that appeard to be just the thing. `SAILING HOLIDAYS',
it declared. `Come and be part of the crew of a sailing vessel. Get away
from it all.'

Well, this looked like just the thing, so he picked up the phone and dialled
the number. A voice answered. `Yes?'

`Uhmmm, well, I saw your advertisement, and I was wondering if I might book a
place on one of your sailing holidays..?'

`Ah, well, you'd have to speak to the Captain of the ship about that. Hang
on, and I'll get him for you.'

A long pause. Finally, a deep gruff voice came on. `Captain Higgs speaking.
You want to go on the sailing trip?'

`Yes,' answered the physicist.

`Well, you're only just in time. We leave next week, and there's only two
places left. Would you rather be the cook or the bo'sun?'

The physicist thought for a minute. `I'd rather be the bo'sun, I think,' he
said at last.

`Good.. ' replied the captain, and then went on to give details of where and
when the ship was leaving. Next week, the physicist was sailing for foreign
shores.

He had a wonderful time on the ship, and came back to his work refreshed and
ready to go (though he never did discover the loveton). He never did forget
the trip, or the holiday he spent as Higg's Bo'sun.

                       Cartoon Laws of Physics
Cartoon Law I
Any body suspended in space will remain in space until made aware of its
situation.
Daffy Duck steps off a cliff, expecting further pastureland.  He loiters
in midair, soliloquizing flippantly, until he chances to look down.  At
this point, the familiar principle of 32 feet per second per second
takes over.

Cartoon Law II
Any body in motion will tend to remain in motion until solid matter
intervenes suddenly. Whether shot from a cannon or in hot pursuit on
foot, cartoon characters are so absolute in their momentum that only a
telephone pole or an outsize boulder retards their forward motion
absolutely.  Sir Isaac Newton called this sudden termination of motion
the stooge's surcease.

Cartoon Law III
Any body passing through solid matter will leave a perforation
conforming to its perimeter.

Also called the silhouette of passage, this phenomenon is the speciality
of victims of directed-pressure explosions and of reckless cowards who
are so eager to escape that they exit directly through the wall of a
house, leaving a cookie-cutout-perfect hole.  The threat of skunks or
matrimony often catalyses this reaction.

Cartoon Law IV
The time required for an object to fall twenty stories is greater than
or equal to the time it takes for whoever knocked it off the ledge to
spiral down twenty flights to attempt to capture it unbroken.

Such an object is inevitably priceless, the attempt to capture it
inevitably unsuccessful.

Cartoon Law V
All principles of gravity are negated by fear.

Psychic forces are sufficient in most bodies for a shock to propel them
directly away from the earth's surface.  A spooky noise or an
adversary's signature sound will induce motion upward, usually to the
cradle of a chandelier, a treetop, or the crest of a flagpole.  The feet
of a character who is running or the wheels of a speeding auto need
never touch the ground, especially when in flight.

Cartoon Law VI
As speed increases, objects can be in several places at once.

This is particularly true of tooth-and-claw fights, in which a
character's head may be glimpsed emerging from the cloud of altercation
at several places simultaneously.  This effect is common as well among
bodies that are spinning or being throttled.  A `wacky' character has
the option of self-replication only at manic high speeds and may
ricochet off walls to achieve the velocity required.

Cartoon Law VII
Certain bodies can pass through solid walls painted to resemble tunnel
entrances; others cannot.

This trompe l'oeil inconsistency has baffled generations, but at least
it is known that whoever paints an entrance on a wall's surface to trick
an opponent will be unable to pursue him into this theoretical space.
The painter is flattened against the wall when he attempts to follow
into the painting.  This is ultimately a problem of art, not of science.

Cartoon Law VIII
Any violent rearrangement of feline matter is impermanent.

Cartoon cats possess even more deaths than the traditional nine lives
might comfortably afford.  They can be decimated, spliced, splayed,
accordion-pleated, spindled, or disassembled, but they cannot be
destroyed. After a few moments of blinking self pity, they reinflate,
elongate, snap back, or solidify.

Corollary: A cat will assume the shape of its container.

Cartoon Law IX
Everything falls faster than an anvil.

Cartoon Law X
For every vengeance there is an equal and opposite revengeance.

This is the one law of animated cartoon motion that also applies to the
physical world at large. For that reason, we need the relief of watching it
happen to a duck instead.

Cartoon Law Amendment A
A sharp object will always propel a character upward.

When poked (usually in the buttocks) with a sharp object (usually a pin), a
character will defy gravity by shooting straight up, with great velocity.

Cartoon Law Amendment B
The laws of object permanence are nullified for "cool" characters.

Characters who are intended to be "cool" can make previously nonexistent
objects appear from behind their backs at will.  For instance, the Road
Runner can materialize signs to express himself without speaking.

Cartoon Law Amendment C
Explosive weapons cannot cause fatal injuries.

They merely turn characters temporarily black and smoky.

Cartoon Law Amendment D
Gravity is transmitted by slow-moving waves of large wavelengths.

Their operation can be wittnessed by observing the behavior of a canine
suspended over a large vertical drop.  Its feet will begin to fall first,
causing its legs to stretch.  As the wave reaches its torso, that part will
begin to fall, causing the neck to strech.  As the head begins to fall,
tension is released and the canine will resume its regular proportions
until such time as it strikes the ground.

Cartoon Law Amendment E
Dynamite is spontaneously generated in "C-spaces" (spaces in which cartoon
laws hold).

The process is analogous to steady-state theories of the universe which
postulated that the tensions involved in maintianing a space would cause
the creation of hydrogen from nothing.  Dynamite quanta are quite large
(stick sized) and unstable (lit).  Such quanta are attracted to psychic
forces generated by feelings of distress in "cool" characters (see
Amendment B, which may be a special case of this law), who are able to use
said quanta to their advantage.  One may imagine C-spaces where all matter
and energy result from primal masses of dynamite exploding.  A big bang
indeed.

Cartoon Law Amendment F
All objects do not  any mass until a small sheet of paper is added,
then all objects have mass.

                      THE LAWS OF AUTOMOTIVE PHYSICS:

1.  As automotive particles move through space, they travel along various
energy states.  Areas with few particles tend to have only 2 or maybe 3
energy states, while congested areas can have up to 6 or 7 energy states.
Counterparticles move through space in the opposite direction, but always
with the same number of energy states available.  Some areas are composed
of antimatter (see Nippobritish matter below) exclusively.

2.  Each auto is composed of several flavors - most autos are made of 4 or
6 flavors, but a fair number have 8 and a few smaller auto particles have
three.  The number of flavors determines both the size of the particle
(from compact to limo) and the acceleration of the particle through space.
Faster acceleration and subsequent higher velocities allow the particles to
move into higher energy states, arbitrarily called left lanes.

3.  There are three states to automotive particle matter - European,
American, and Mexicaribbean.  European matter is the most ordered, with
particles staying in their lowest energy states except when accelerated to
speeds faster than nearby particles.  American matter is somewhat ordered,
with some particles maintaining their lowest states.  However, some
particles, particularly older ones, tend to randomly drift into higher
energy states without the speed needed to maintain that state.  This
creates bottlenecks and can increase the viscosity of American matter until
it moves at the speed of molasses.  The most chaotic form is Mexicaribbean
matter (MC).  MC matter consists of poorly defined, meandering energy
states.  Particles move at random angles in all directions, arbitrarily
bouncing into various energy states.  Accelerations tend to be rapid and
velocities high, resulting in frequent collisions between particles and
their counterparticles, and rapid changes between highly viscous,
slow-moving matter and high-velocity, fast-flowing matter.

4.  American matter has been successfully reduced in temperature to a state
of near absolute zero - the point where acceleration and velocity are both
near or at zero.  Automotive physicists, being quirky, named this
low-temp. state "Rush Hour".

5.  American matter also behaves in odd, yet predictable ways.  For
instance, it is a well known fact that as the number of available energy
states expands, the number of slow-moving particles expands to match the
number of available energy states.  The result is that some slow-moving
particles will move into all the higher energy states available, creating
the molasses effect whether there are 2 or 6 energy states.  These
particles come in many different varieties, named "idiot", "imbecile",
"moron", etc.  The slowest particles have much more offensive names, and
can occasionally result in other particles firing small, yet powerful
microparticles at the slow particles - ending in the destruction of the
slow particle.

6.  American matter is also unpredictable in some ways, particularly with
regards to its reactivity with other substances.  Ethyl alcohol, for
instance, can cause particles to become frozen and clogged due to
collisions with particles in the same energy state, or can make the
particles reverse spin and jump into an inverse energy state, where they
can be annihilated in collisions with their counterparticles.  However, the
alcohol-treated particle tends to escape destruction more often than the
untreated particle.  Treating American matter with cannabinoids tends to
slow down the particles to a crawl, and impart a glassy look to them.

7.  American matter is increasingly being affected by electromagnetic
radiation in the "cellphone" bandwidth.  It tends to cause the particles
affected by it to move more randomly, especially moving into and out of
different energy states.  It also causes increased numbers of particle
collisions.  However, it can facilitate the decay of particles that
collided, to keep the molasses effect from being too great.

8.  There is a peculiar species of antimatter, called Nippobritish matter.
It moves in energy states completely opposite of European and American
matter, and most Mexicaribbean matter.

Any automotive physicists who are experts on European matter or MC matter
are welcome to share their insights into these forms of matter.

1. Conservation of Energy - the total energy (i.e. the sum of potential and
kinetic energy) of a closed system doesnt change under the influence of
conservative forces. Closed means that the system doesnt exchange matter
with its environment.

<A lawyer should never transform potential to kinetic energy without the
appropriate safeguards for payment of attorney's fees. The law firm is a

in front of you, the clock starts ticking and so does billing time." Try
changing that and YOU GET FIRED !>

2. Conservation of Momentum - momentum is the product of mass and
velocity. As energy is related to time, momentum is to space.

<Mass and velocity - the more cases you have, the faster you must work or

3. Newton's First Law - a body on which no forces are acting will continue

                         Quantumtheory of Politics
                             by Steffen Knack

Abstract :

An introductory summary about failed attempts to employ quantitative
methods to social and political sciences is given. A new and hopefully
successful attempt will be presented by using theories and methods derived
from modern quantum physics.

Introduction

It has long been seen as a major weakness of the social and political
sciences that they lack the mathematical precision, which has been the key
to the great successes of the natural sciences. As a consequence great
expectations [1] have been set in almost every new mathematical theory of
the last decades, e.g. catastrophe theory and chaos theory. Yet, while it
is from a intuitive point of view logical to try to adopt catastrophe or
chaos theory to politics, experience has shown that only the names but not
the mathematical substance of these theories are well suited for this task
[2].

Catastrophe theory deals with the structural stability and instability of
potentials. While no-one can deny that there are many instabilities in
world politics, the existence of a structure is by no means evident. Indeed
the failure of this theory gives prove of the total absence of any
structure whatsoever.

A first view at chaos theory, which deals with very complex systems, again
suggests a successful application in political science. A closer look
however reveals that chaos theory is only applicable to the so-called
determined chaos, which evolves out of a set of well defined rules. Anyone
who wants to try to establish a set of rules in politics, clearly lacks any
sense of reality. This means that chaos theory will turn out - and indeed
has already done so - to be a again a complete failure.

In this grim situation there might nevertheless be hope coming from a
direction the least expected : quantum physics. In the following we will
give a rough outline of the basic features of quantum theory. The main part
of this work consists of practical applications which show a first glimpse
of future triumphs in this field.

Theory of Quantum Physics

The overwhelming success of quantum theory stems from the fact that from
the very beginning it is concerned with probabilities rather than
certainties. These probabilities are mathematically represented by
wave-functions which are vectors of an abstract Hilbertspace or in the case
of many-particle systems a Fockspace. The time development of these
functions is given by Schroedinger's equation

                       i/h * d/dt(Psi) = H(t) * Psi

where H(t) is the so-called Hamiltionian of the system. Of the many results
which can be deduced using this seemingly simple equation we will make
mostly use of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle which states

                     dX * dP > h/2  or  dE * dt > h/2

This shall suffice as a short introduction to the most important concepts
of quantum physics and we will proceed with the more interesting part of
applications in politics.


Application of Quantum Physics in Politics

The System of German Democracy

As it is always best to use specific examples for illustration, we will
start out with describing the German Democracy in terms of quantum
theory. The first step is to choose a irreducible base of our system, which
is given by |CDU>, |SPD>, |FDP>, |Greens>, |PDS>. Let us assume for sake of
simplicity that Germany is a closed system, i.e. we will at first neglect
the impact of foreign policy. A rather simple calculation then yields the
astonishing result that Kohl is an eigenvalue of German Democracy
(unfortunately the 1998 national elections have taken place meanwhile,
contradicting this and the following statements [3]. Yet, recognizing the
clarity and logic of the reasoning we prefer theory to reality). Given an
eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenfunction, which here evidently is the
|CDU>|FDP> coalition, one can always eliminate time dependence. This means
we have found a static solution which solves the time-independent
Schroedinger equation

                     H Psi(Kohl) = E(Kohl) * Psi(Kohl)

Thus we have derived very easily an explanation for the fact that there has
been no progress in Germany for the last 14 years.

Next, we want to analyse political elections. As an example, let us
consider the question of the probability of a political change after the
next election. (The reader is asked to keep in mind, that these
probabilities have already turned into certainties, which, while having
been very unlikely, are now certain.) It is evident to every physicist that
one only has to calculate the matrix element of transition

                            W = <CDU|E1998|SPD>

where E1998 is the election-operator of 1998 (which is of course hermite,
the outcome of elections being an observable). We now have only to consult
linear algebra and to remember that  |CDU> and |SPD> both belong to an
orthogonal base to see that

                                    W=0

We want to remark here that the above calculation holds only if the system
is not observed, because only then can the time-development described by
Schroedinger's equation be applied. Any observation of the system will of
course lead to an immediate collapse of the wave-function. Thus as an
spin-off from our calculation we now understand why polls frequently fail
to produce correct predictions (and we have found someone to blame: this
damned pollsters ruined our nice paper) .

World Trade and National Politics

As we now turn our attention towards global economics we will find the
Heisenberg relations to be of great practical use. The world wide free
trade like it is set down in the GATT treaty [4] means an increase in dX
which infers an decrease in dP. As E is given in the non-relativistic case
as E = P^2/(2m) this means that dE also decreases, which again results in
dt getting bigger. Thus we have found a theoretical explanation for the
empirically well known fact, that in global trade delivery times tend to be
longer than in regional markets.

Another question of great interest is the problem of the influence of
national policies in a world of global markets. Concerning world trade
national governments can almost only resort to tariffs and customs. In our
quantum theory we can describe this situation in terms of potential
barriers which are setup by national governments. International trade now
means nothing else than the scattering of particles by these potential
barriers. Thus we are able to take the well established facts of the
quantum theory of scattering and apply them to our problem. The first
result that we obtain is the fact that the higher the potential barrier
(i.e. the higher the customs) the less likely are foreign goods to enter
the local market. This is in perfect agreement with the predictions of the
standard theories of economics [5]. But our theory does more than that : We
see for instance that not only the height of the potential barrier but also
its width is of importance, which means that import duties of big national
economies like the USA or Japan influence world economics rather more than
smaller economies like Costa Rica or Liechtenstein. Even such irregular
phenomena like smuggling and bootlegging, which the older theories
regularly failed to describe, are an integral part of quantum theory
represented by the well investigated tunneling phenomena. We see that the
whole variety and complexity of international economics can thus be
described with quantum theory.

Conclusion

We have tried to choose the most simple and vivid examples and generally
have kept mathematics to a minimum. Yet, even those few examples give a
glimpse of the vast variety of possible future applications of this
approach. When one considers that we didn't even use powerful concepts and
theories like quantum field theory, Feynman diagrams and the violation of
parity by weak interaction, one cannot be but awe-stricken by the thought
of what will become possible in the future. We personally set our highest
hopes in the CPT-Theorem and its consequences for politics. If policies can
be developed which show an invariance under time reversal this could be the
answer to the socio-economic and political problems of our troubled days
[6].

from the Car Talk Mailbag...
William L. Roes sent the following letter (response sent from
mail@cartalk.com).

Dear Tom and Ray,

I would like to discuss a subject that I am sure most individuals simply
take as a fact of our daily existence: losing things!

An example: on more than one occasion while working on the car, I would
drop something--a nut or bolt--and look for it in every location it
could possibly have landed, only to discover that it was just not there.
What would add to the frustration of the whole experience was that once
I had surrendered to the futility of the search, there the object would
be...in plain sight.

My mother used to say when something had strangely disappeared that it
had fallen into a void. Later, when the object was recovered, it had
somehow fallen back out of the void. That explanation did not satisfy my
need to understand this mysterious phenomenon. I am happy to announce,
after years of diligent effort, the answer is available.

The turning point in the investigation was the realization that certain
types of materials have a greater chance of being affected by this
phenomenon. (This was discovered only after the disappearance of socks
was found to be caused by an entirely different set of circumstances.)
While this temporary disappearance can happen to any object under the
right conditions, it occurs more often in metal objects subjected to a
great deal of stress in their formation (i.e., nuts, bolts, earrings,
keys, etc.).

What occurs is that when the object falls and strikes the ground, this
causes vibration at the atomic level. In objects with a highly ordered
crystalline structure (metals), it is possible to get all the atoms to
vibrate in unison if the object is below a certain limiting size. So
this usually happens only to small objects; the conditions required for
this to happen to very large items will be discussed later. When the
neutrons vibrate in unison it causes the subatomic gravitons to emit a
type of energy not yet fully understood. The phenomenon has been named
Graviton Oscillation Neutron Emission, or GONE for short. This energy
field actually causes the object to shift in relative time. The degree
of temporal shift is dependent on the amount of energy released It may
shift just a few moments, in which case you may find the object while
conducting your search. On other occasions it may take minutes, hours or
months, or you may never catch up with the item in the stream of time.

For larger objects the energy from the impact is not sufficient to cause
a shift in time. However, sympathetic vibrations due to resonance can
spread throughout the structure, causing the temporal shift to occur
later. This has been observed in mall parking lots where a car door had
been slammed, and after a few minutes have passed the car disappears.
This phenomenon is usually accompanied by a position shift as well, such
that when the automobile reappears, it is in a different parking space
than the one you are quite sure you left it in. In a few instances the
vehicles have been found miles away from the point of disappearance,
somewhat worse for wear from their journey through time and space. And
often missing tires and electronic components, oddly enough.

So, now that this phenomenon is understood, it should relieve us all of
unnecessary anxiety. When you can't find your keys or your car, just
wait--it's only GONE temporarily. It will pop up when it falls out of
the void.

         OBSERVATION OF WARM NUCLEAR FUSION IN CONDENSED SOUP
by Joseph D. Lykken
Santa Cruz Inst. for Particle Physics
Univ. of Calif., Santa Cruz, CA 95064

(Work supported by DOE, contract DE-AA03-76SF00010)

ABSTRACT

We report the observation of warm nuclear fusion of deuteron pairs
catalyzed by a concentrated colloidal suspension of avian lipids.  We
present a simple theoretical model relating this process to superstring
theory, quantum wormholes, fractal geometry, and high temperature
superconductors.  A straightforward scaling argument shows that the total
annual energy requirements of the United States can be produced from
approximately 137.03602 g of catalyst.

1.  INTRODUCTION

Recent observations of cold nuclear fusion of deuteron pairs, through
electrolysis in solutions of metallic salts, has generated considerable
excitement in the physics community and elsewhere.  The fusion catalysis
process described by Fleischmann and Pons does, however, have several
drawbacks when considered as a putative means of mass power generation.
The process is slow, requiring a continuous electrical power input of
several hours before the onset of fusion.  In addition, this process
requires costly palladium or titanium cathodes, as well as highly toxic
combinations of dissolved metallic salts.

The modified *warm* fusion process which we have discovered (independently)
and which is described in this paper suffers none of these disadvantages.
In our process, the salt solution is augmented by a concentrated colloidal
suspension of certain avian lipid compounds, available in an inexpensive
commercial preparation (i.e., Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup) in
arbitrarily large quantities.  This preparation is not only nontoxic, but
actually healthful.  Instead of requiring several hours of applied external
current, our process induces fusion after gentle heating to 90 degrees
Celsius, maintained for five minutes.  The palladium cathode is replaced by
an inexpensive chromium-plated utensil, which is given an approximately
circular motion induced by elementary mechanical means.

Since our fusion catalysis technique is so simple, we will not belabor the
description of the process itself, but instead focus on the analysis of the
data and present an obvious theoretical model for the underlying physics.

2.  NEUTRON CALORIMETRY AND DATA ANALYSIS

Although, as we shall demonstrate, our warm fusion technique can readily
produce a net power output in the terawatt range, our initial experimental
setup operated at a more modest scale.  Rather than resorting to direct
detection of fusion product neutrons, we employed a highly accurate neutron
calorimetry procedure.  We first measured the total external power supplied
to our system.  This involved reading the electric meter on the circuit
containing our (electrically powered) heating apparatus, and correcting for
other power drains on the circuit, such as lightbulbs, radios, and video
cassette recorders.  We then corrected this power reading for the
electricity/heat conversion efficiency of our apparatus, taken from an
authoritative source (c.f.  _The World Book Encyclopedia_).  Further
corrections were made for cosmic ray background radiation incident on our
apparatus, energy deposition from proton decay within the apparatus, and
additional heat from minor amounts of paprika contamination.

To determine the total energy output from 300 seconds of catalyzed fusion
events, 400 cc of the solution was ingested by a 75 kg male homo sapien
volunteer subject.  After a short digestion period, the subject was led
through a series of mechanical tasks ("The Jane Fonda Ultimate Challenge
Workout") and the resulting power output -- estimated by sophisticated
nonlinear biodynamic integro-differential hyperelliptic functional
analysis, simulated numerically on a Cray XMP supercomputer.  Details of
this analysis will be presented in a future publication.

The results of our analysis for a 400 cc catalytic solution were as
follows:
Total average external power input:	{hfill}1193.762 watts
Total average power output:{hfill}	1196.885 watts
Net average power output due to fusion:	{hfill}  3.123 watts

3.  THEORETICAL MODEL

Although our experimental results may seem somewhat surprising to the
uninitiated, there is a simple theoretical explanation of the underlying
physics responsible for efficient warm fusion catalysis in lipid
suspensions.  As is well known, the principal obstacle to deuteron fusion
is the Coulombic potential barrier induced by the electrostatic repulsion
of the positively charged particles.  A straightforward application of
ten-dimensional heterotic superstring dynamics shows that deuterons can
percolate through the Coulomb barrier through the spontaneous generation of
quantum wormholes.  One can easily see why this process is enhanced in the
presence of suspended avian lipids by applying the Anthropic Principle.
Obviously, if the laws of physics did not produce such an enhancement, we
could not have observed it in our universe, and a contradiction of our
material existence would result.  The perforation of the Coulomb barrier by
quantum wormholes is elegantly described in terms of fractal geometry; an
analytic continuation to planar surfaces produces analogous electromagnetic
anomalies in resonant spin liquids, thus explaining the behavior of high
temperature superconductors.  Details of this model will appear in a future
publication.

4.  FUTURE OUTLOOK

We have considered the problem of scaling up our warm fusion technique to
provide the commercial and strategic defense power requirements of the
United States.  The appropriate scaling law was obtained by repeating our
initial experiment, but adding only half as much water to our commercial
preparation as called for in the instructions.  With this additional
concentration of the catalytic solution, we obtained a net power output
increase of 0.00016%.  Clearly, by continuing to halve the amount of added
water, we can obtain an arbitrarily high power of this enhancement factor,
and thus any level of power output desired.  We estimate that, by limiting
the amount of added water to 3 micrograms (easily accomplished through
national technical means), more than 10 terawatts of warm fusion power
could be produced.

We strongly urge, and fervently hope, that the power of chicken soup will
only be used for peaceful purposes.

Crank Unified Theories: The CUTting edge of Fuzzy Science

Quite recently the Institute of Fuzzy Science has announced the discovery
of several bold new theories, providing a unified explanation, or at least
excuse, for a broad range of natural phenomena.  These theories are both
extremely ambitious in their scope and modest in their assumptions.  Their
main trait is that they deduce a great deal from practically nothing.

The creation of Crank Unified Theories is an old and honorable tradition,
dating back to prehistoric times, when our ancient ancestors looked around
them and asked, "How the heck did *this* all get here?"  The process was
lent considerable prestige by such luminaries as Aristotle and Ptolemy, in
the classical age, and continues up to this day.  One recent idea by a
worker outside the Institute was Photon Mechanics, which postulated that
all fundamental particles were composed of photons.  In an attempt to prove
this, he tried to synthesize a meal from gamma rays.  Unfortunately, the
food immediately propagated away at 299,000 kilometers per second, leaving
critics of the light lunch unsatisfied.

"Terrible," one physicist commented.  "Much too bland."  Others seemed to
agree.

The CUTs produced at the Institute of Fuzzy Science are notable in that
they all contradict each other, and sometimes themselves.  Thus, few would
argue that all, or even most, are correct.  The most successful theory to
date is that of Dr.  Isaac M.  Woozy, commonly known as Woozy Theory.
Woozy Theory has proven capable of predicting practically anything you put
to it.

What is Woozy Theory?  In its simplest outlines, it is an attempt to
describe nature by unifying three separate realms of observation: General
Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, and Scrabble.  By adopting a three pronged
approach the theory is able to resolve the apparent contradictions between
each of the sub-theories.

"I believe that the problems of earlier researchers," stated Dr.  Woozy,
"arose from treating the subjects piecemeal.  A unified approach is
required."  He cites difficulties with Superstring Theory, Quantum
Scrabble, and Scrabble in Curved Spacetime.  In each case, he maintains,
difficulties arose from neglecting a broad class of other phenomena.  "My
discovery was serendipitous," he recalls.  "I'd been wrestling with various
theories for weeks without getting anywhere.  Finally, in my office, I
picked up Merzbacher's Quantum Mechanics in one hand and Misner, Thorne and
Wheeler's Gravitation in the other -- well, I touched it, anyway, it's too
heavy to lift.  Just as I was staring at both of them, my Scrabble set fell
from the top shelf and hit me on the head."

With the blow came illumination.  If one merely assumes that Scrabble must
exist, the rest of nature follows.  Gravity, for example, is necessary to
keep the pieces on the board.  Electromagnetism provides light, to see the
letters with.  One critic pointed out the possibility of magnetized pieces;
Woozy pondered for hours until he had resolved the conflict to his
satisfaction.

"One not only needs gravity to keep the pieces on the board," he explained,
"but also to provide an atmosphere, so the players can breathe."  When the
critic began to suggest pressure suits and space colonies, Woozy silenced
him with a skillfully thrown paperweight.

"I take my work seriously," he declared.

Most exciting of all, Woozy theory provides the first coherent explanation
for the universe as a whole.  If Scrabble is necessary, then so are
players, and a universe to play in.  Woozy calls this the "Really Strong"
or "Scrabble" Anthropic Principle.  Humans (or at least intelligent beings)
are necessary, providing an order to biological evolution which has been
lacking since the failure of the Chain of Being.  This also suggests that
if aliens exist, they may well play Scrabble.

"That doesn't mean that they will speak English, necessarily," Woozy added
cautiously.  "There are foreign language versions, after all.  And the
point values may differ, somewhat."  He suggested to SETI that they listen
for very long range Play By Mail games.  At present, his suggestion has not
been acted on.  "They're just miffed that they didn't think of it," Woozy
sniffed.

Rival theories include unifying QFT and GR with chess or checkers, or even
tic-tac-toe.  While the originators of these theories remain hopeful, Woozy
is pessimistic.

"Those games are extremely difficult to unify with Quantum Mechanics,"
Woozy explained, "since they lack an element of chance.  And tic-tac-toe
doesn't even have pieces, so gravity is pretty shaky as well.  Plus it's a
drawn game (no pun intended).  Who'd want to live in a universe that
boring?"  Woozy also recalled an early game of quantum chess: "After about
thirty moves, black was both mated and not mated.  It made for terrible
arguments."

Are these, or similar theories, the answer to the riddle of the universe?
Most observers doubt it.  Still, as Dr.  Woozy himself points out, "What
the heck, it keeps us off the streets."

BULLETIN BOARD BIOMASS: An Energy Alternative for the 21st Century

Richard L. Hoffmann, Ph.D. AESOP
Loco Director
Division of High Entropy Chemical Physics and Nuisance Herbs,
Tuscarora,  75757


Introduction:

That we are enjoying a lull in the great energy wars of the past decades
must not diminish our commitment to developing a means by which our
nation may gain freedom from the threat of the oil embargo. Scientists
at the Loco Institute of Educational Synectics (LIES) have been working
diligently toward a solution to this imminent problem.  We are pleased
to announce a major breakthrough that we believe can meet our nation's
energy needs now and in the foreseeable future. It involves a heretofore
unknown violation of the law of conservation of matter. Though the law
states that matter cannot be created or destroyed, only changed from one
form to another, Loco research and management personnel, subsequently
abetted by various funding and government agencies, have discovered that
matter can apparently be created out of nothingness. The discovery is
remarkable in that the demonstrated process is able to generate huge
volumes of combustible cellulosic material with a single and quite
familiar transducer -- a bulletin board.

Historical:

The biomass converters and the application described herein originated
in 1967 at our institution's satellite facility, Informational
Coprocessors Corporated (ICC) initially housed in temporary buildings
located on a bluff above the Illinois river near Washington, Illinois.
Though the staff was small, an astute member of our team noticed early
on that bulletin boards tend to fill spontaneously with bulletins. It
made no difference where the bulletin board was located -- if nearly
empty one day, it would be found full the next. No one was ever able to
observe directly a bulletin board in the act of biomass proliferation.
However, many have witnessed the
staggering quantities of sheet firewood that each unit was able to
accumulate.

Presently, we have a team investigating a possible inverse relationship
between the growth rates of bulletin board biomass and that of the
elusive Morel mushroom -- no one has ever seen one of them grow either.
We hope to publish that research at a later date in the Journal of
Manure Science.

Experimental:

Preliminary experiments indicated that bulletin boards under the control
of administrative personnel held the greatest potential as a source of
biomass. Theirs were emblazoned with colorful and varied biomass units
which were easy to see and harvest. Each fuel pod was affixed to the
substrate with a quartet of convenient and easily removed needle-like
units that bore a cylindrical plastic appurtenance designed to be
gripped with the fingers; a degenerate form of the device is recognized
as a thumbtack. On administrative terrain, at least, it appeared to
matter little if the bulletin boards were inside enclosures. Although
harvest was somewhat encumbered by an enclosure, it seemed to have no
retardant effect whatever on the rate at which the board was able to
breed copious biomass.

Field tests carried out on experimental plots throughout the Loco
Institute revealed that there was an optimum harvest-to-latency period
which influenced yields. Apparently, as biomass accumulates, the
supporting acreage is unable to maintain further production. This
clearly indicated that if sustained high yields were to be enjoyed, a
program of vigorous pruning must be implemented and maintained
throughout the useful lifetime of the biomass generator.

----------

It is imperative that we insert a cautionary note for any who may
implement our proposal -- the process can very easily run out of control
and generate consequences ghastly to contemplate and impossible to
rectify. Kinetic studies indicate that the rate determining reaction is
zero order -- concentration dependent on nothing. It is a
hyperbolic-hypergolic chain reaction that is impossible to moderate once
it has proceeded beyond the induction period.  We refer interested
researchers to the seminal efforts of Shmidgall, et al, "The Paper
Blob", Helvetica Federal Expressica Acta, (7), 2.71828, 1983.  Loco
therefore suggests the exercise of extreme caution and it disclaims any
liability for attendant damage which may be caused by the imprudent use
of our schemata.

----------

Procedure:

In theory, virtually any fossil-fueled power plant can be modified to
use biomass that might be harvested from bulletin boards. It is proposed
that we mount a national effort to place numerous bulletin boards
everywhere and harvest the biomass that is all but certain to appear
upon them. Small children could be trained in early life to harvest
small bulletin boards, thereby becoming accustomed to the endless work
they will face as adults in a world filled with these heretofore
unrecognized biomass generators. They would gain an early opportunity to
taste the fruits of stoop labor as they gleaned the floors for fallen
biomass. Unemployment would be cut drastically because, until fully
automated harvest machinery is developed, biomass collection would be
labor-intensive.

Like windpower, bulletin board biomass is best exploited where it is
found in highest concentration.  By coincidence, both resources are in
bountiful supply in Washington, D.C. and in any organization that deals
with governmental agencies. Washington windpower has already been
treated in our paper, "The Bicameral Ram-Air Effect: A Biometric Boom",
-- Journal of Kinetic Flatulence (37), Pork 3.14159, 1978. -- and is
beyond the scope of the present treatment.

Other promising locations for bulletin board biomes include areas near
the offices of safety inspectors, union chiefs, athletic managers and
their supporters, near time-clocks, plant gates, bureaucrats both major
and minor, staff mailboxes, and anywhere bulletin boards are found in
educational institutions -- it is well known that those sited there are
pretreated with a redolent spawn of academic humus which can attract
substantial biomass.

Because everyone represents a cog somewhere in a bureaucratic machine,
each has a capacity to make some contribution to the solution of our
nation's energy problem. Supervisory and administrative personnel are in
the best position to take the lead in this effort. Admittedly, their
biomass generators are state-of-the-art devices. That fact
notwithstanding, each of us has an obligation to make whatever
contribution we can by emulating their example; alas, to equal them is
known to be impossible.

Prognosis:

We envision vast fleets of combines groaning across the limitless
bureaucratic veldt. Biomass from these sources alone appears to be
infinite.  Preliminary data suggest it is quite possible that a
nation-wide effort to establish even a few properly sited small bulletin
board biomass farms could produce annual yields that would easily
outstrip the accumulated tonnage of planetary copies of the National
Geographic Magazine, -- J. Irr. Results., (20), No.3, 22, 1974. For this
reason we offered the earlier caveat; the concept is not trivial and
merits all due caution.

Because it will be impossible to stockpile the overwhelming tide of
biomass that will result once such farms are established, the citizenry
must be carefully reprogrammed to abandon their misguided notions as to
the benefits of energy conservation.  They should be encouraged to raise
their energy demands by whatever means at their disposal.  This includes
building homes with extra bathrooms so that all children could be
retrained to leave the lights on. The scientific community is encouraged
to step up its activities in genetic engineering so that we may develop
humans with six ears and thus make it possible for everyone to own and
use more powerful portable stereo sound systems. The Sahara could be air
conditioned by use of a heat pump connected to the North pole.  Some of
the excess energy could be used to provide each citizen with his/her own
black hole and thereby solve the problem of litter, pollution, and
overpopulation in one fell swoop.

Conclusion:

Definitive experiments have clearly established that there is no
theoretical limit to the size of the harvest that may be obtained from
bulletin boards. No one has ever seen an empty bulletin board. Large or
small, each is capable of a truly frightening fecundity only approached
in vigor by a congressman's relentless quest for perquisites in an age
of economic shortfall or by the academician's penchant for junketing.

Loco directors and staff scientists work tirelessly in the service of
our nation toward the end that one day our cracked organization will be
the first to overthrow the second law of  thermodynamics. After which,
energy will breed energy and all may enjoy the life they deserve.

Dr. Verhagen,

Thank you for your speedy response regarding our paper on Bulletin Board
Biomass (BBB)-- and for your willingness to include it in your very
fascinating web-site.

Indeed, we are in agreement with your reviewer regarding the perpetual
motion aspects of BBB. Thus, our precautionary note that once initiated,
the process could have consequences too ghastly to behold.

Early on, before relevant experimental parameters were fully
established, a quite modest pilot plant experiment ran amok. To bring
matters under control we were forced to back-feed the excess electricity
from our generator into the power grid. Our local coal-fired utility
company was subsequently forced to cut itself from the national grid for
almost 13 days. Alas, ramifications spread. Trainloads of coal backed up
at the local deposition points snarled traffic for almost a month.

I would be pleased to send you full technical details of this incident.
However, documents regarding it were stored in an unused closet that
inadvertently contained a few coat-hangers. As you know, left
unattended, coat-hangers can multiply more quickly than a Cray. Though
this (storage) incident occurred some years ago, we are still entangled
in the process of untangling tons of coat-hanger tangles. Several
members of our team, unable to cope with the strain, have withdrawn from
our program and are now resting comfortably in the care of Dr. Anthony
Hopkins at a resort named "Wellville."

I hope these remarks are clarify our paper. Should you wish to append
them to its presentation we would be agreeable.

Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Templeton:

Due to frustrations I have experienced in recent months, I am forced to
turn to you for help. For you see, I have made a remarkable discovery, that
at present, I have had little luck in impressing upon a public made overly
skeptical by wild and unsubstantiated claims made by crackpot media hounds
posing as scientists. These imposters have sullied the public mind to true
and enlightened breakthroughs, and I have been unable to have my work taken
seriously at any of the well-respected scientific journals. I turn to you
in desperation, and I know that my evidence will meet with unbiased,
objective reason before your forum.

I have discovered that a simple organic fabric, liberally soaked in an
aqueous solution of di-hydrogen oxide, and then spun in a high temperature
superconducting gyroscope, will experience a anomalous weight loss due, for
the most part, to a cold fusion reaction.

I describe my experimental procedure: An ordinary, carefully sorted load of
all cotton fabrics was soaked in a distilled solution of di-hydrogen oxide.
This load was carefully weighed and then put into the high temperature
superconducting gyroscope. After a thirty minute exposure to a lateral
spin, the load was removed and carefully weighed a second time. In every
case, the second measurement indicated an anomalous weight reduction.

Due to the absence of the aqueous solution after the spin, I theorize that
this weight reduction is caused by a cold fusion reaction between the two
hydrogen atoms in the di-hydrogen oxide molecule to produce one helium and
one oxygen molecule. Since helium is lighter than air, perhaps this
contributes to the weight reduction. The fact that I was unable to detect a
noticeable release of heat confirms that this is in fact cold fusion. I
expect that the organic nature of the cotton fabric in some way provides a
catalyst for this reaction to take place. With this in mind, I attempted to
determine if live organic matter would increase the effect. Unfortunately,
the experiment was unconclusive as my cat, Fluffy, failed to remain in a
live state over the duration of the experiment. Four further experiments,
using various rodents, achieved similar results, leading me to conclude
that the anomalous weight loss effect is not a suitable diet technique for
humans.

I know that the gyroscope is superconducting since the metal casing is
clearly marked "Amana Superconvection Dryer." Now, as we all know,
convection is nearly the same as conduction, so this is what they must
really mean. I know that it is a high-temperature superconductor because
the temperature switch was set on "High" throughout the experiment.

The ramifications of this discovery are enormous. However, my every attempt
to describe this important effect has fallen on deaf ears. Please help me
spread the word about this earth-shattering breakthrough.

                  The Philogiston Theory of Electronics*

A sheet of paper crossed my desk the other day and as I read it,
realization of a Basic Truth came to me.  So simple!  So obvious we
couldn't see it!  John Kuivinen, Chairman of the Palomar Repeater
Committee, (an amateur radio group), I think has discovered what makes
intigrated circuits work.  He says that smoke (yes, you read smoke) is the
thing that makes ICs work because every time you let the smoke out of it,
the IC stops working.  I was flabbergasted!!!  Why of course he's right!!!

Smoke makes all things electrical work.  Remember the last time the smoke
escaped from your Lucas voltage regulator?  Didn't it stop working?

I sat and smiled like an idiot as more of the truth dawned.  It's the
wiring harness that carries smoke from one device to another in your
machine and when the harness springs a leak, it lets the smoke out all at
once, and then nothing works.  Can't you see now why motors have to be
large to handle all that smoke, and don't they have smoke all over the
inside when they quit working?  Think about it!

                            ELEPHANT COLLIDERS

It's very tricky & very expensive to collide sub atomic particles
together. CERN is such a drain, so perhaps we need a new method.  Lets
collide something bigger together. If we can see the particles, it's so
much easier.

Lets use elephants on rollerskates.

One elephant is launched down a ramp towards a stationary target
elephant. As they impact they can richoche off each other or merge to
become a compound animal. This will then emit other animals and decay to
something more stable, like a Giraffe.

Using this new method, Physicists have discovered that the wombat is
responsible for carrying the charge between electrons, not the
photons. They are now working with higher energies to create new heavier
compound animals. Once a blue whale is created, scientists hope that higher
energies will reveal new animals, perhaps dinosaurs.

It's also possible to examine the structure of the elephant. By firing a
smaller animal, for example a badger, at the elephant it will penetrate,
exposing the hidden fine structure.

The disadvantages are cleaning up afterwards. But elephants die off pretty
quickly in comparison to the biproducts of nuclear fission!

From an article in Physics Today by Gary Taubs:

                         ONWARD TO THE DESSERTRON

   The machine will be the most ambitious scientific instrument ever: a
colossal doughnut-shaped accelerator so immense that all the jelly and
cream in the world could not fill it.  Dubbed the "Dessertron", it will
create twin beams of ice cream, one vanilla and one chocolate, and will
smash them together at energies of 40 trillion sprinkles (40 jimmies), one
thousand times more powerful than any ice cream smasher ever made.  Because
matter and energy are equivalent in desserts, eternally linked by
Einstein's famous equation:

  (extra weight) = (mass) x (speed of consumption) squared

when these beams collide, they will do more than make soft yogurt.
Theorists believe that scattered among the debris of the collisions will be
elementary flavors and new desserts hundreds of times more fattening than
any known now.

   "Every time we have increased energy by a factor of 1000," says
high-calorie fizzicist Sherbet Glace' of Harvard (who won the 1979 Nobel
Prize for proving that at temperatures above 10 to the 28th power jimmies,
strawberry rhubarb and French vanilla are both aspects of the same
fundamental God-like flavor) "we have discovered something new.  At one
sprinkle, we discovered the banana.  At one thousand, we figured out that
frappes, westerns, malteds and milkshakes were simply different variations
of ice cream and milk.  At a million, we discovered fudge and made
brownies, and were content.  The next big step was another factor of 1000,
and quantum crust theories were invented as well as the Little Jack Horner
uncertainty principle.  It's clear that what we need to do is study
desserts at several trillion sprinkles."

   In July, the High Calorie Dessert Advisory Panel of the Food and Drug
Administration recommended that the number one priority in research for the
next two decades should be the ice cream accelerator officially named the
Superconducting Super Osterizer (SSO).  The mammoth blender, as they have
proposed it, would be as much as 120 miles in diameter with several
different speeds from puree all the way through whip.  It would take twelve
years to build and cost $2.2 billion, but it would also chop, dice, slice,
and make moist icing.  Among the desserts that scientists hope the machine
will find are the raspberry quark, the Higgs Sundae (which may be
responsible for defining the caloric content of all fundamental desserts
during spontaneous symmetry breakfasting); those desserts predicted by the
theory techniflavor, which postulates that the Higgs Sundae is not a
fundamental dessert but is actually a bound state of more elementary
desserts; and the particles of sugarsymmetry, which include spumpkin and
specan pies, banino splits and banino cream pies and several different
flavors of antipastries.

    Ever since the SSO was proposed in July, it has become the hottest plum
     in science. Brighams, Carvel, Baskin-Robbins, Friendlies, LuCerne and
      Sealtest have already put in bids for the machine and many more are
  expected.  The state of Texas has promised that if the machine is built in
   Texas, it will pay for the tunnels and the refrigeration equipment needed
    to cool the ice cream down to a few degrees above absolute zero to save
     money on artificial preservatives.  When the SSO is finished, it will
   assure the U.S.  pre-eminence in desserts well into the 21st century, and
      says Carob Rumraisin, the famous Italian fizzacist and discover of
  intermediate vector bonbons and low-calorie cannoli, "Once this machine is
       built, American scientists will finally get their just desserts."

                                ADMINISTRATIUM
                                        By William Buvitt
[The Physics Teacher, January 1989]

April 1, 1988:  The heaviest element known to science was recently
discovered by physicists at Turgid University.  The element,
tentatively named Administratium (Ad), has no protons or electrons,
which means that its atomic number is 0.  However, it does have 1
neutron, 125 assistants to the neutron, 75 vice-neutrons, and 111
assistants to the vice-neutrons.  This gives it an atomic mass number
of 312.  The 312 particles are held together in the nucleus by a force
that involves the continuous exchange of meson-like particles called
memoons.

Since it has no electrons, Administratium is inert.  However, it can be
detected chemically because it seems to impede every reaction in which
it is present.  According to Dr.  M.  Langour, one of the discoverers
of the element, a very small amount of Administratium made one reaction
that normally takes less than a second take over four days.

Administratium has a half-life of approximately 3 years, at which time
it does not actually decay.  Instead, it undergoes a reorganization in
which assistants to the neutron, vice-neutrons, and assistants to the
vice-neutrons exchange places.  Some studies have indicated that the
atomic mass number actually increases after each reorganization.

Administratium was discovered by accident when Dr.  Languor angrily
resigned from the chairmanship of the physics department and dumped all
of his papers into the intake hatch of the university's particle
accelerator.  "Apparently, the interaction of all of those reports,
grant forms, etc.  with the particles in the accelerator created the
new element."  Dr.  Langour explained.

Research at other laboratories seems to indicate that Administratium
might occur naturally in the atmosphere.  According to one scientist,
Administratium is most likely to be found on college and university
campuses, near the best-appointed and best-maintained buildings.

An alternate version:
From: zdxc0d@amoco.com (David Crowson)

Physicists at Harwell have discovered the heaviest element
known to science, named Administratum. The new element has no
protons or electrons, and has an atomic number of zero.
However, it does have one neutron, eight assistant neutrons,
ten executive neutrons, 35 vice neutrons and 258 assistant
vice neutrons.

Administratum has an atomic mass of 311 1/2, since the neutron
is only detectable half of the time. Its 312 particles are
held together by a force which involves the continuous
exchange of meson-like particles, called morons.

Since it has no electrons, Administratum is completely inert.
Nevertheless, its presence can be detected because it impedes
every reaction with which it comes into contact. One
experiment, which should have lasted only a few days, is
still running after 2= years due to the addition of just one
milligramme of Administratum.

It is weakly active, and has a normal half-life of
approximately six months. After this time, it does not
actually decay, but undergoes a metamorphosis in which
assistant neutrons, executive neutrons, vice neutrons and
assistant vice neutrons exchange places. This almost
invariably leads to an increase in atomic weight, hence it is
self-sustaining.

Although it occurs widely, Administratum tends to concentrate
around large corporations, research laboratories and
government departments. It can especially be found in
recently re-organised sites, and there is reason to believe
that it is heavily involved in the processes of deforestation
and global warming.

It should be remembered that Administratum is known to be
toxic at all concentrations, and can easily destroy any
productive reactions where it is allowed to accumulate.
Numerous attempts have been made to determine how
Administratum can be controlled to prevent irreversible
damage, but results to date are not promising.

From: tornberg@netcom.com (Neal E. Tornberg)

Research at other laboratories indicates that Administratium occurs naturally
in the atmosphere. It tends to concentrate at certain points such as
government agencies, large corporations and universities and can usually be
found in the newest, best appointed and best maintained buildings.

One major problem is that proximity to this substance tends to make the
process of getting anything done (such as getting grant money) more
time-consuming, which makes the experiments in question extremely
time-consuming.

Philosophers have long wondered why socks have this habit of getting lost,
and why humans always end up with large collections of unmatched odd
socks. One school of thought says that socks are very antisocial creatures,
and have a deep sense of rivalry. In particular, two socks of the same
design have feelings of loathing towards each other and hence it is nearly
impossible to pair them (e.g. a blue sock will usually be found nestling up
to a black one, rather than its fellow blue sock).

On the other hand, quantum theorists explain it all by a generalised
exclusion principle --- it is impossible for two socks to be in the same
eigen-state, and when it's in danger of happening, one of the socks has to
vanish. Indeed the Uncertainty Principle also comes in --- the only time
you know where a sock is, is when you're wearing it, and hence unable to be
sure exactly how fast it's moving. The moment you stop moving and look at
your sock, it then starts falling to pieces, changing colour, or otherwise
becoming indeterminate. Either way, socks may possess Colour and
Strangeness, but they seem to lack Charm.

Theories about disappearing socks--the two you cited are wrong.  It has
long been known that the sock is the larval form of the coat hanger.

            The Dark Sucker Theory (courtesy of rec.humor.d)
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    For years, it has been believed that electric bulbs emit light,
but recent information has proved otherwise.  Electric bulbs don't
emit light; they suck dark.  Thus, we call these bulbs Dark Suckers.

    The Dark Sucker Theory and the existence of dark suckers prove
that dark has mass and is heavier than light.

    First, the basis of the Dark Sucker Theory is that electric bulbs
suck dark.  For example, take the Dark Sucker in the room you are in.
There is much less dark right next to it than there is elsewhere.  The
larger the Dark Sucker, the greater its capacity to suck dark.
Dark Suckers in the parking lot have a much greater capacity to suck
dark than the ones in this room.

    So with all things, Dark Suckers don't last forever.  Once they are
full of dark, they can no longer suck.  This is proven by the dark spot
on a full Dark Sucker. The dark which has been absorbed is then
transmitted by pylons along to power plants where the machinery uses
fossil fuel to destroy it.

    A candle is a primitive Dark Sucker.  A new candle has a white wick.
You can see that after the first use, the wick turns black, representing
all the dark that has been sucked into it.  If you put a pencil next to
the wick of an operating candle, it will turn black.  This is because
it got in the way of the dark flowing into the candle.  One of the
disadvantages of these primitive Dark Suckers is their limited range.

    There are also portable Dark Suckers.  In these, the bulbs can't
handle all the dark by themselves and must be aided by a Dark Storage
Unit.  When the Dark Storage Unit is full, it must be either emptied
or replaced before the portable Dark Sucker can operate again.

    Dark has mass.  When dark goes into a Dark Sucker, friction from
the mass generates heat.  Thus, it is not wise to touch an operating
Dark Sucker.  Candles present a special problem as the mass must travel
into a solid wick instead of through clear glass.  This generates a
great amount of heat and therefore it's not wise to touch an operating
candle. This is easily proven for lightbulbs too. When you compress a
gas, it gets hot, right?  So the light bulb gets hot because of all the
dark being squished into the wires.

    Also, dark is heavier than light.  If you were to swim just below
the surface of the lake, you would see a lot of light.  If you were to
slowly swim deeper and deeper, you would notice it getting darker and
darker.  When you get really deep, you would be in total darkness.  This
is because the heavier dark sinks to the bottom of the lake and the
lighter light floats at the top.  The is why it is called light.

    Finally, we must prove that dark is faster than light.  If you were
to stand  in a lit room in front of a closed, dark closet, and slowly
opened the closet door, you would see the light slowly enter the closet.
But since dark is so fast, you would not be able to see the dark leave
the closet. So next time you see an electric bulb, remember that it is
not a light emitter but a Dark Sucker.

The following line doesn't quite fit into the theory but almost does : -
Ever seen the blue glow in vacuum tubes?  That's because electrons are blue.

            More on darksuckers: THE DARKSUCKER CONSPIRACY (DC)

DARK CONSPIRACY INVOLVING ELECTRICAL POWER COMPANIES SURFACES
Updated 8/7/88 W0PN

For years the electrical utility companies have led the public to believe
they were in business to supply electricity to the consumer, a service for
which they charge a substantial rate. The recent accidental acquisition of
secret records from a well known power company has led to a massive
research campaign which positively explodes several myths and exposes the
massive hoax which has been perpetrated upon the public by the power
companies. The most common hoax promoted the false concept that light bulbs
emitted light; in actuality, these 'light' bulbs actually absorb DARK which
is then transported back to the power generation stations via wires. A more
descriptive name has now been coined; the new scientific name is for the
device is DARKSUCKER.  This newsletter introduces a brief synopsis of the
darksucker theory, which proves the existence of dark and establishes the
fact that dark has great mass, and further, that dark is the fastest known
particle in the universe. Apparently, even the celebrated Dr. Albert
Einstein did not suspect the truth.. that just as COLD is the absence of
HEAT, LIGHT is actually the ABSENCE of DARK... light does not really exist!

The basis of the darksucker theory is that electric light bulbs suck
dark. Take for example, the darksuckers in the room where you are. There is
much less dark right next to them than there is elsewhere, demonstrating
their limited range. The larger the darksucker, the greater its capacity to
suck dark. Darksuckers in a parking lot or on a football field have a much
greater capacity than the ones in used in the home, for example.

It may come as a surprise to learn that darksuckers also operate on a
celestial scale; witness the Sun. Our Sun makes use of dense dark, sucking
it in from all the planets and intervening dark space. Naturally, the Sun
is better able to suck dark from the planets which are situated closer to
it, thus explaining why those planets appear brighter than do those which
are far distant from the Sun. Occasionally, the Sun actually oversucks;
under those conditions, dark spots appear on the surface of the
Sun. Scientists have long studied these 'sunspots' and are only recently
beginning to realize that the dark spots represent leaks of high pressure
dark because the Sun has oversucked dark to such an extent that some of
actually leaks back into space. This leakage of high pressure dark
frequently causes problems with radio communications here on Earth due to
collisions between the dark particles as they stream out into space via the
black 'holes' in the surface of the Sun.

As with all manmade devices, darksuckers have a finite lifetime. Once they
are full of dark, they can no longer suck. This condition can be observed
by looking for the black spot on a full darksucker when it has reached
maximum capacity... you have surely noticed that dark completely surrounds
a full darksucker because it no longer has the capacity to suck dark at
all.

A candle is a primitive darksucker. A new candle has a white wick. You will
notice that after the first use the wick turns black, representing all the
dark which has been sucked into it. If you hold a pencil next to the wick
of an operating candle, the tip will turn black because it got in the way
of the dark flowing into the candle. Unfortunately, these primitive
darksuckers have a very limited range and are hazardous to operate because
of the intense heat produced.

There are also portable darksuckers called flashlights.  The bulbs in these
devices cannot handle all of the dark by themselves, and must be aided by a
dark storage unit called a battery. When the dark storage unit is full, it
must be either emptied (a process called 'recharging') or replaced before
the portable darksucker can continue to operate. If you break open a
battery, you will find dense black dark inside, evidence that it is
actually a compact dark storage unit.

The darksuckers on your automobile are high capacity units with great
range, thus they require much larger dark storage units mounted under the
hood of the vehicle.  Since there is far more dark available in the winter
season, automobile dark storage units reach capacity more frequently than
they do in the summer, requiring 'recharging', or in severe cases, total
replacement.  Dark has great mass. When dark is drawn into a darksucker,
friction caused by the speed of the dark particles (called anti-photons)
actually generates substantial heat, thus it is unwise to touch an
operating dark sucker. Candles represent a special problem, as the dark
must travel into a solid wick instead of through clear glass. This
generates a great amount of heat, making it very dangerous to touch an
operating candle.  Because dark has such great mass, it is very heavy. If
you swim just below the surface of a lake, you see a lot of 'light'
(absence of dark, to be more precise). As you go deeper and deeper beneath
the surface, you notice it gets darker and darker. When you reach a depth
of approximately fifty feet, you are in total darkness. This is because the
heavier dark sinks to the bottom of the lake, making it appear 'lighter'
near the surface.  The power companies have learned to use the dark that
has settled to the bottom of lakes by pushing it through turbines, which
generate electricity to help push the dark into the ocean where it may be
safely stored for their devious purposes.

Prior to the development of turbines, it was much more difficult to get the
dark from the rivers and lakes to the ocean. The Indians recognized this
problem, and developed means to assist the flow of dark on it's long
journey to the ocean. When on a river in a canoe travelling in the same
direction as the flow of dark, they paddled slowly, so as not to impede the
flow of dark; but when they travelled against the flow of dark, they
paddled vigorously to help propel the dark along its way.

Scientists are working feverishly to develop exotic new instrumentation
with which to measure the actual speed and energy level of dark. While such
instrumentation is beyond the capabilities of the average layman, you can
actually perform a simple test to demonstrate the unbelievable speed of
dark, right in your own home.  All that is required for the simple test is
a closed desk drawer situated in a bright room. You know from past
experience that the tightly shut drawer is FULL of dark.  Now, place your
hand firmly on the drawer's handle.  Quickly yank the drawer open.. the
dark immediately disappears, demonstrating the blinding speed with which
the dark travels to the nearest darksucker!

The secrets of dark are at present known only to the power companies. Dark
must be very valuable, since they go to such lengths to collect it in vast
quantities. By some well hidden method, more modern power 'generation'
facilities have devised methods to hide their collection of dark. The older
facilities, however, usually have gargantuan piles of solidified dark in
huge fenced in areas. Visitors to these facilities are told the huge black
piles of material are supplies of coal, but such is not the case.

The power companies have long used code words to hide their activities;
D.C. is Dark Conspiracy, whole A.C. is Alternate Conspiracy. The intent of
the A.C. is not yet known, but the D.C. is rapidly yielding it's secrets to
the probing eyes and instruments of honest scientists around the world. New
developments are being announced every day and we promise to keep the
public informed of these announcements as they occur via this newsletter.

Re: Dark Sucker Theory

  It is far more parsimonious to support the theory that dust is actually
dead light (as one can readily observe by the dust that is illuminated in
beams of light and by the dead light found under a bed) which clearly runs
counter to the dark sucker theory.

This is a mutation of a posting from one the net's most prolific fungi,
the B.S.  in PHYSICS from Eau Claire who posts long weirdness to most
newsgroups (fortunately, news:rec.humor.funny is moderated).  It was
originally titled "Larsonian Physics and Astronomy."  Very little has
been changed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

GARY LARSONIAN Physics and Astromomy

Orthodox physicists, astronomers, and muffin manufacturers CLAIM to be
looking for a "Unified Field Theory" in which all of the forces of the
universe can be explained with a single set of laws or equations.  But
they have been systematically IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one
for 30 years!

The Cartoonist Gary B.  Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory
of the physical universe, which he calls the "The Far Side", is built
on several fundamental postulates about the physical and mathematical
natures of space, time and oreo cookies:

  1.  The physical universe is composed entirely of ONE element:  humor,
      in THREE EASY PARTS:  space, time, and FUNKY WEIRDNESS.

  2.  The physical universe adapts to the needs of humor in a
      non-predictable relation.

  3.  Pudgy-faced children with glasses are DANGEROUS.  They shrink
      their parents into MASON JARS.  This PROVES the existence of the
      Illumanti conspiracy, using the Masons as a FRONT!

From these postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE Theoretical
Universe, using various combinations of squid, cows, scientists,
tentacled aliens, dogs, horn-rimmed glasses, and chocolate shakes.
THESE ALL TRAVEL AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT IN RELATION TO LIGHT PARTICLES.
This is clearly illegal.

At each step in the development, Larson was able to MATCH objects in
his Theoretical Universe with objects in the REAL physical universe,
(squid, cows, scientists ...).

All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy complex
mathematics, in his cartoons.

BOOKS of Gary B. Larson

The following is a complete list of the late Cartoonist Gary B.
Larson's books about his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the
physical universe.  Some of the early books are out of print now, but
still available through inter-library loan.

  1.  "The Far Side" (1981)

  2.  "Revenge of the Far Side" (1984)

  3.  "Beyond the Valley of the Far Side" (1986)

  4.  "Robert McElwaine" (1993)

[The last four chapters EXPLAIN Robert McElwaine.]

Several of them, INCLUDING the last one, are available from:  The
International Society of Larson Worship (ISLW), 1680 E.  Atkin Ave.,
Salt Lake City, Utah 84106.  This is the organization that was started
to promote Larson's Theory.  They have other related publications,
including the quarterly journal "E = mc squid".

Cartoonist Gary B. Larson's Background

Cartoonist Gary B.  Larson was a baby for several years, but then
retired.  He was five years old when he entered primary school, where
he was FORCED TO TAKE NAPS!  Western society is at a low point when the
PRE-EMINENT GENIUS OF THE WORLD is forced to waste PRECIOUS TIME
napping!  He was 22 years old when he graduated with a Bachelor of
Science Degree (which makes him a scientist) in Zoology.  He developed
his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe while
trying to develop a way to DRAW SQUID with only a BLUEBERRY MUFFIN!

Larson's lack of a fancy "PH.D."  degree might be one reason that
orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is NOT A VALID REASON.
Sometimes it takes a relative outsider to CLEARLY SEE THE MUFFIN
THROUGH THE RASPBERRY JAM.  At the same time, it is clear from his
books that he also knew ORTHODOX physics and astronomy as well as ANY
physicist or astronomer, even Einstein or Hawkings, well enough to
point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF
IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, LACK OF SQUID, ETC..

Larson did NOT have the funds, etc.  to experimentally test his Theory.
And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.  He simply drew his theory.

A SELF-CONSISTENT CARTOON WORLD is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX
physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking for A
SELF-CONSISTENT CARTOON WORLD that works, but have been IGNORING one
for over 10 years now!

"Modern physics" does NOT explain the physical universe so well.  Some
parts of some of Larson's books are FULL of quotations of leading
orthodox physicists and astronomers who agree -- like Percival
Peewhittle, B.S.  in PLANT TOPOLOGY; and Robert McElwaine, B.S.  in
PHYSICS.  And remember that "BLONDIE", "GARFIELD", "ZIGGY", "ZIPPY",
etc., ALSO once SEEMED to explain it well, but were later proved
CONCEPTUALLY WRONG.

Prof.  Jethro Clampett, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior, was/is a
STRONG PROPONENT of Larson's Theory, and was (or still is) President of
Larson's organization, "THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF SQUID", and Editor
of their quarterly Journal "Squid have NO FEET".  He moved to Tycho
Brahe after retiring.

Sex or physics discovers the joy of: Quite a surprise, the JOY of sex. Who
would have expected it? Imagine you are in your teens and it will take
another dozen years of intense study to master sex. The years are filled
with uncertainty.  Sex is damn hard. It's not for everyone. You have to
work long hours at it and neglect other things. Will you qualify?  And then
what? Sure, you're good at it but will you get a job doing sex? Come on,
gang, be realistic. What we need is The Joy of Physics. Lavishly
illustrated, it will show all the positions by which you can go blind
squinting at spectra.

Marketing or Physics Finally Learns How to Write a College Catalog Entry:
(Physics 101, in competition with comparable courses of other science
departments, is a Quantitative Lab Science Elective for non-science
majors.) Students, listen up. You don't want to get acid burns on your
clothes. You don't want to cut up frogs. You don't want to spend your days
cracking rocks in the vain hope that the inside will differ from the
outside or your nights freezing on the roof waiting for the clouds to pass
so you can peek at the moon. I didn't think so. Take Physics 101. The
objective is to learn a little useful science and get a grade you and I can
both live with without either of us suffering too much. Sound good?

The Legal Profession or Physics Discovers Advertising: Don't get burned
twice. Your experiment has failed to produce the desired result. It's not
your fault. It's the equipment. It's the manufacturer. They didn't do the
job. Sue them. Physics Legal Aid will handle your case. Remember, if you
don't get paid, we don't get paid. And we always get paid.

The Medical Profession or Physics Discovers Billing: Someone has a sick
experiment. That's your cue and a cue for all other physicists within
hearing. You simply show up one morning, read the thermometer, and mail in
a bill for two hundred dollars. It works like magic. And most patients
recover. The insurance company pays and we all feel better.

Major League Sports or Physics Discovers Free Agency: (Be careful; this
strategy works best for twenty game winners or thousand yard rushers, in
other words Nobel Prize candidates.) My client has worked through his
contract and is not free to sign with any other school run by millionaires.
So bid him up. Maybe when all bids are in he'll re-sign with the same
school for ten times his former salary. Plus incentives. Multi-year offers
only.

Telemarketing or Physics Discovers Matchmaking: Have I got a physicist for
you? She's fresh out of school, our latest product. She programs in many
languages. She builds equipment. She can pull a vacuum with best of
them. And don't worry, fans, she checks for hidden leaks and repairs them.
But that's not all. Your ginsu physicist takes data, analyzes it, fits it
to standard models. That's still not all. At the command WRITE she will
type your paper meeting the requirements of PHYS REV. Attractive enough to
be in your own home yet sufficiently durable for the laboratory, this
physicist will make you the envy of your friends. And she is almost willing
to share housework or babysitting 50/50. Make that 25/75 and you do the
cooking. Not sold in stores.

Astrology of Physics Encounters the Daily Newspaper: (Can you believe the
Hartford Courant?) If today is your birthday and you are reading this
column, you're out of your mind. What are you doing? Get out, get a life,
study physics. (Getting control over my word processor.) Energy will be
conserved.  Use it well. Entropy will be created. Try not to worry.
Discoveries will be made. By someone. (This shows the strong resemblance
between astrological divination and Chinese cookie fortunes.)

PHYS 123 Physics for Artsies
       This is admittedly a blatent attempt to increase enrollment in
       physics and simultaneously offer paid early retirement to some
       of our department members. But hey, what about 'Rocks for
       Jocks', or 'Computers for Clutzes'? Why are we expected to be
       the one department in the University that only offers quality
       courses? So if you need a science credit, and want to do as
       little work as possible to get it - remember 1-2-3. (Those who
       have already taken MATH 3.14159 Numbers, Fingers, and Stuff
       will have an advantage in remembering this.)

       Having weeded out all but the most highly intelligent students
       with PHYS 201, we are now able to get into the real meat of the
       subject of Electromagnetic waves and fields.
       Topics Include: optics, relativity, gauge transforms

PHYS 456 Advanced Physics for Artsies
       We are presently the only Physics Department in the world to
       offer an advanced physics course especially geared for
       humanities students. Our consistent offering of this course is
       evidence of our belief that Physics is indeed a subject for
       everyone. In fact, Dr. M.C. Skewaired (who has been teaching
       this class for the last 14 years) has often said in defense of
       the funding for the course 'if I ever get any students, they
       will love this class'.
       Topics Include: which way is down?

I am a Physics teacher at The International School of Bucharest. Your site
is a real treasure, and  I wanted to add a small jewellery:
It happened in my class..
'We were talking about the acceleration of free-fall. I wrote a 'g' letter
on the board, and asked 'How can we measure this constant? Do you have any
idea?' One of them stood up, came to the board, and measured the length of
the 'g' letter on the board, and said 'by a ruler, teacher!'

Here is a simple experiment that will teach you an important electrical
lesson: On a cool, dry day, scuff your feet along a carpet, then reach your
hand into a friend's mouth and touch one of his dental fillings. Did you
notice how your friend twitched violently and cried out in pain? This
teaches us that electricity can be a very powerful force, but we must never
use it to hurt others unless we need to learn an important electrical
lesson.

It also teaches us how an electrical circuit works. When you scuffed your
feet, you picked up batches of "electrons", which are very small objects
that carpet manufacturers weave into carpets so they will attract dirt. The
electrons travel through your bloodstream and collect in your finger, where
they form a spark that leaps to your friend's filling, then travels down to
his feet and back into the carpet, thus completing the circuit.

Amazing Electronic Fact: If you scuffed your feet long enough without
touching anything, you would build up so many electrons that your finger
would explode! But this is nothing to worry about unless you have
carpeting.

Although we modern persons tend to take our electric lights, radios,
mixers, etc., for granted, hundreds of years ago people did not have any of
these things, which is just as well because there was no place to plug them
in. Then along came the first Electrical Pioneer, Benjamin Franklin, who
flew a kite in a lighting storm and received a serious electrical shock.
This proved that lighting was powered by the same force as carpets, but it
also damaged Franklin's brain so severely that he started speaking only in
incomprehensible maxims, such as "A penny saved is a penny earned."
Eventually he had to be given a job running the post office.

TRANSFORMATIONS AND DISTRIBUTION

Dear Dr. Science,

I am interested in Fourier Transformations and the Theory of
Distribution.  Can you help me?

       -- Prabir Mitra, Katowice, Silesia/Poland

What could you possibly need help with?  Why, those transformations are
as plain as the nose on my face.  Think of them as a filter that detects
random patterns and sends them far, far away.  The Theory of
Distribution is the way the random garbage finds its way to the dump.
The dump used to be on Staten Island, but now it's on a barge, circling
the world, looking for a port that will accept it.  If Poland doesn't
watch out, all the world's random patterns will end up there or in
Czekoslovakia.  Throw them into the Baltic, it's already so polluted no
one will notice.  At least that's what the Soviets thought.

The following story was submitted by Russell Bray. It illustrates something
that we Physicists have to live with... people who remain completely
convinced of something that is incorrect even when corrected by someone who
knows more about the subject than they do.

I am a Arizona State Secondary Ed Major with emphasis in Physics.  In a
class of Secondary Ed students (none of which are Physics), we were having
group discussions. The dude giving his lecture (Theatre Major) asked the
class what makes the sky blue. We were to get in groups of five, discuss,
and come up with a collective answer.

I was not surprised when two groups decided that the sky was blue because
the reflection of the ocean. I come to expect that, deal with it, and
realize that they were lied to by their parents or second grade
teacher. What I didn't expect was that the guy asking didn't know
either. After I gave my response of scattering of the sun's light waves
through the atmosphere, he said close, but no.  Interesting. "What pray
tell, is it" I ask.

He says, "Because our atmosphere is mostly Nitrogen Oxide, all the rays
of the sun are absorbed by the molecules but blue, just like this blue
folder absorbes all but blue rays." To a certain degree I see his point,
but I couldn't leave it alone.

"Why is a sunset red" I ask.

"Pollution. We have beautiful sunsets because we have dirty air." He says
confidently.

                          HEAVY BOOTS
About 6-7 years ago, I was in a philosophy class at the University  of
Wisconsin,  Madison (good science/engineering school) and the teaching
assistant was explaining Descartes.  He was trying to show how  things
don't  always  happen  the  way we think they will and explained that,
while a pen always falls when you drop it  on  Earth,  it  would  just
float away if you let go of it on the Moon.

My jaw dropped a little.  I blurted "What?!" Looking around the  room,
I  saw  that only my friend Mark and one other student looked confused
by the TA's statement.  The other 17 people just  looked  at  me  like
"What's your problem?"

"But a pen would fall if  you  dropped  it  on  the  Moon,  just  more
slowly." I protested.

"No it wouldn't." the TA explained calmly,  "because  you're  too  far
away from the Earth's gravity."

Think.  Think.  Aha!  "You saw the APOLLO astronauts walking around on
the Moon, didn't you?" I countered, "why didn't they float away?"
"Because they were wearing heavy boots." he responded, as if this made
perfect  sense  (remember, this is a Philosophy TA who's had plenty of
logic classes).

By then I realized that we  were  each  living  in  totally  different
worlds,  and  did not speak each others language, so I gave up.  As we
left the room, my friend Mark was raging.  "My God!  How can all those
people be so stupid?"

I tried to be understanding.  "Mark, they knew this stuff at one time,
but  it's  not  part  of  their  basic  view  of the world, so they've
forgotten it.  Most people could probably make the same mistake."
To prove my point, we went back to our dorm room  and  began  randomly
selecting names from the campus phone book.  We called about 30 people
and asked each this question:

1. If you're standing on the Moon holding a pen, and you let go,
   will it a) float away, b) float where it is, or c) fall to the
   ground?

   About 47 percent got this question correct.  Of the ones who got
   it wrong, we asked the obvious follow-up question:

2. You've seen films of the APOLLO astronauts walking around on the
   Moon, why didn't they fall off?

About 20 percent of the people changed their answer to the first
question when they heard this one!  But the most amazing part was
that about half of them confidently answered, "Because they were
wearing heavy boots."

The following was sent to me by Dr.Adrian Melott, Associate Professor of
Physics and Astronomy here at the University of Kansas:

                    THE BURNING QUESTION OF HEAVY BOOTS

I put two multiple choice questions on my Physics 111 test, after the study of
elementary mechanics and gravity:

13. If you are standing on the Moon, and holding a rock, and you let it
    go, it will:
        (a) float away
        (b) float where it is
        (c) move sideways
        (d) fall to the ground
        (e) none of the above

25. When the Apollo astronauts were on the Moon, they did not fall off because:
        (a) the Earth's gravity extends to the Moon
        (b) the Moon has gravity
        (c) they wore heavy boots
        (d) they had safety ropes
        (e) they had spiked shoes


        The response showed some interesting patterns!  The first question
was generally of average difficulty, compared with the rest of the test:
57% got it right.   The second question was easier: 73% got it right.

        So, we need more research to explain the people who got #25 right
but did not get #13 right!

        The second interesting point is that these questions proved to be
excellent discriminators:  that is, success on these two questions proved to
be an extremely good predictor of overall success on the test.

        On the first question, 92% of those in the upper quarter of the test
score got it right; only 20% of those in the bottom quarter did.  They generally
chose answers (a) or (b).  On the second question, 97% in the upper quarter
got it right and 33% in the lower quarter did.  The big popular choice of
this group was (c)...33% chose heavy boots, followed closely by safety ropes
at 27%.

        A telling comment on the issue of fairness in teaching elementary
physics:  Two students asked if I was going to continue asking them about
things they had never studied in the class.

The recent business of Heavy Boots (TM) was being discussed by my Engies
the other day when I arrived to take them for a class. (I tutor a couple
of freshman Engineer classes in Physics for the University.)

Anyway, they were arguing about this, and decided they'd ask me what the
situation was.  I talked about gravity and how all matter/energy
gravitates, etc.  The Sun gravitates and all the stars, etc etc.  I had
to also explain that, contrary to what some of them thought, gravity
acts even when there is no air (!!); that the Moon has gravity despite
having no atmosphere.  This took some convincing(!), but I clinched it
with the experiment with the hammer and feather -- they weren't
wearing Heavy Boots, and yet still fell.

I then proceeded to discuss the nature of scientific theories, testing
hypotheses, keeping an open mind but remaining sceptical, the usual
stuff.  I tend to get very animated when I talk Physics, and raise my
voice, gesticulate, pace, and generally carry on.  After some 20 minutes
of this talk about Science (TM) and Scientific Method (TM), I finished
up with something like "So that is how Science is done.  Formulate
theories, test them and believe them only when and how far they predict
experimental results. ... Now, any questions?"

One girl up the back raises her hand, "Yes, I have one.  You got very
worked up over this -- are you a Scorpio?"

We read an article claiming that the average American does not know the
correct answer to the following question:

If a pen is dropped on a moon, will it:
A) Float away
B) Float where it is
C) Fall to the surface of the moon

So a bunch of us TA's got together and gave our physics classes quizzes asking
this question.  Out of 168 people taking the quiz, 48 missed the question.
The responses are below.  Some people didn't write comments.  The spelling and
grammer were not changed, however, clarifying comments are enclosed in []'s.

{ed A report is that only 3 of the 48 were in this course.  The rest were
from lesser courses.}

Physics 324 - Modern Physics for Engineers

"A body is at rest tends to stay at rest, plus there's no gravity"

"The gravity of the moon can be said to be negligible, and also the moon's
a vacuum, there is no external force on the pen.  Therefore it will float
where it is."

"The pen will float away because the gravitational pull of the moon, being
approximately 1/6 that of the earth, will not be enough to cause the pen to
fall nor remain stationary where it is.  The gravatational pull of other
objects would influence the pen"

Physics 222 - Second Semester Calculus-based Introductory Physics

"Because moon has gravitation 1/6 of the gravitation of earth the force will
be small toward the moon [so it will float away]"

Physics 221 - First Semester Calculus-based Introductory Physics

"It will fall to the earth by force of gravity and by the attraction between
the earth and the moon"

"Because the gravitational pull of the moon is much weaker than that of the
earth.  And object such as a pen is so lite that it will float"

"Because there are no external forces if you let go [it will float where it is]

"External forces that are present on the moon will attract the pen.  There
isn't gravity on the moon as there is on earth so the pen won't drop."

"Since there is no gravity it will float and fall slowly.  It will not fall
like in the ground quickly because there is no gravity"

"The force of gravity on the moon is a fraction of the gravity on the earth,
so the moon would not be able to attract the pen to inself.  Rather, it would
only be able to suspend the pen"

"It will eventually fall to the surface of the moon because of the slight
gravitational field plus the moment of inertia about the moon.  Also with
angular momentum being conserved, it must fall.  I=MR^2"  [We were studying
conservation of angular momentum when I gave this quiz]

"The pen will fall to the surface of the moon.  As we let go we will
introduce some initial enerty into the pen thus putting it in a forward
downward motion.  Since on the moon there is no force of resistance the pen
will fall very slowly towards the surface"

"If you are standing on the moon holding a pen and you let go, it will float
where it is.  It will not fall to the surface of the moon because a
gravitational force strong enough to cause this does not exist.  In addition,
the pen does not have a lot of external force on it, so it will not be likely
to move"

"The pen will fall to the surface of the moon because the moon generates a
gravitational field by rotating and the pen must act under this force".

Physics 111 - First semester Non-calculus Physics

"It will float where it is because there is no gravity force on the moon.
Also, if you just let go there isno acceleration so it should just float
where it is."

"There is no gravitational force on the moon, the pen therefore has no
weight so its mass has no effect on 'where it goes'.  Plus, you know, there
is no wind to blow the pen up there! =)"

Astronomy 150 - Physics for humanities majors

"[It will float where it is] Because there isn't a real strong gravity force
on the moon.  Actually it is like having none at all.  If I remember right,
it is only like 2.9m/s (force of gravity)"

"It will float away because the gravity of the moon won't pull it down to the
surface, but it won't stay where it is because there is always some force
acting on mass - (even though the gravity of the moon isn't strong enough)"

"The gravity of the earth will pull it more than that of the moon, so it will
float toward earth"

"It'll float away because your body is not able to stay completely still.  So
it would float in the direction your hand was shaking"

"There is not much gravitational pull on the moon to have it fall to the
surface.  The pen is so small and light, it probably would not be affected
by the gravitation of the moon so it would float away."

"There is no gravity in space so if you just let it go, it will just gently
float away."

"It will float away because the gravitational force is less than here on the
Earth where it would fall.  I think it will float away because of what I have
seen of the space rooms NASA uses to get astronauts ready for flight."

"Theoretically, it should float away because it has no mass, gravity does not
pull the pen towards the surface at a great enough rate to make it fall,
however it does have enough force to keep it floating and ultimately it will
drift away."

"Because there is no gravity on the moon.  Therefore it would float away
because there is nothing to hold it there or to pull it to the surface of
the moon"

"[It will float away] Because there would be no gravitational force to hold
it there or make it fall to the surface of the moon"

"There is no gravitational pull on the moon to cause pen to come back towards
surface.  The pen would float away probably toward the gravitational pull of
the earth."

"[It will float where it is] Because there is no gravitational pull.  It will
neither fall towards the moon because there is no gravity to pull it there
nor is there any other gravitational force that will pull it away from the
moon."

"Float where it is and will not move because there is no gravitational pull,
it will not float away unless it is pushed."

"The gravity on the moon is such that it won't be pulled to the surface, and
since the pen won't make any movement it should float where it is."

"It will float where it is until a force acts upon it.  There is no gravity
to act upon it."

Astronomy 120 - Physics for brain-dead

"[It will float away because there is] no gravity to hold it and no atmosphere"

"[It will float away] because the gravity on the moon is not as great as it
is on the earth"

"Because the earth is a greater mass and the pen will be pulled toward the
greater body because of gravity.  The moon doesn't have that great of a
gravitational pull"

"No gravitatational pull so it won't fall and no force pulling it away so it
will float where it is"

"Lack of gravity on moon allows pen to float in space"

"Because there is no gravitational pull on the moon, there is no pull towards
the moon or away from."

"The moon doesn't have gravity like the earth which would bring the pen down
to the surface instead the moon's atmosphere would cause it to float above
the moon's surface."

"Gravity will not pull it down, because there is less of it.  It shouldn't
float away just because I've never seen it happen.  There's a balance between
gravity and the opposite force."

"It would float where it is because gravity would not let it fall to the
surface (there is no gravity) on the moon.  It would not float away because
it has no mass."

        About eight years ago, when I was studying in high school in
India, my Chemistry professor was trying to explain the "screening
effect" of electrons (a phenomenon that makes metals bind their
electrons less losely then other elements, resulting in conductivity).
        He tried to give an analogy, using earth and moon.
He said, "Imagine if their was another moon orbiting earth, then the
pull that our true moon faces will be smaller." I was puzzled and
declared that it is not possible. To which he further explained," Well
it's like this. The earth now has to pull two moons instead of one
hence it has to divide its force among the too, hence its pull on the
moon will be halved."
        At this point I argued that all the artificial satellites in
the sky must face lesser pull by earth when ever a new satellite is
launched. " That's true," he said,"and that's why the cost of
launching satellites is going up these days...."

pankaj@bu-pub.bu.edu's story reminded me of something I learned in my high
school physics class.

We were talking about surface tension, and the teacher had just
demonstrated a floating razor blade and a drop of detergent.  Out of
curiosity, I asked whether surface tension could have any effect on
something the size of a battleship.

"Well, yes," he said.  "That's how they float."

Seeing our amazement, he even shared an anecdote to support this.  "Sure,
when I was your age, some friends and I went down to the pond one night and
threw in a bunch of soap.  The next morning, all the rowboats were at the
bottom of the pond!"

                     Asteroid Science According to NBC
* Asteroids travel through space making a noise like a powerful but subdued
engine.

* Asteroids are usually locked into orbits, but if a comet comes by, they
can be bumped out of their rut and become dangerously unstable.

* It's only the fact that everything is locked into an orbit which prevents
collisions in our solar system. Any asteroid that gets loose is certain to
crash into Earth within a matter of hours.

* It's just barely possible to evacuate Kansas City to a distance of 100
miles in 48 hours. This requires lots of airplanes. It also requires
martial law, so that 'looters will be arrested on sight'. (Have they no
mercy?) With 30+ hours to go, people will panic in the streets and run
around at random.

* A mile-wide asteroid can mostly burn up in the atmosphere, causing it to
do only a relatively small amount of damage (bursting a dam) when it
strikes.

* A river from a burst dam can exactly keep pace with a pickup truck for
several minutes. It will then obligingly pause as the pickup truck turns
around and goes in another direction.

* When a raging river washes over a pickup truck on a bridge, the bridge
won't be damaged, the truck won't be swept off the bridge, and people in
the open back of the truck won't be swept away.

* A four-mile-wide nickel asteroid (which would mass about a *trillion*
tons) can be destroyed -- literally destroyed, so that nothing remains --
by three airplane-mounted lasers.

* But with only two airplane-mounted lasers, it instead instantly explodes
into thousands of pieces. Astronomers are very surprised that it wasn't
literally destroyed.

* Laser beams are easily visible in space.

* Incoming asteroids spend several minutes in Earth's atmosphere.

* Asteroids made of softer or more volatile stuff than nickel will
harmlessly burn up in the atmosphere regardless of size.

* Asteroids that land in the ocean will do no damage regardless of size.

* Asteroids are discovered by astronomers peering directly through their
telescopes in brightly lit observatories. Whatever they see will appear on
computer monitors, however.

* Asteroid positions are reported in plainly audible 75 BPS Baudot teletype
signals.

* Oddly, there will be no dog to be rescued at the last possible moment.
Maybe only tornadoes and volcanoes come equipped with dogs. Would you
settle for goldfish?

                          PROOF THE EARTH IS FLAT
Hello. If anyone out there watched a Learning Channel show "In Search of
the Edge of the World", they heard some pretty bizarre (though creative)
conclusive proofs the earth is flat. A sampler:

According to the theory of continental drift, all the continents can
shift about the surface of the earth as if on a bed of some viscous
fluid. Were the earth round and rotating, centrifugal force would make
all the continents slosh to the equator, but this is a contradiction,
as it is not the actual case. QED

A plumb bob always points to the center of the earth (assuming the
earth is a sphere). Then a plumb bob used by someone else in a different
place would make a different angle to an impartial observer. Since
builders use plumb bobs to make buildings stick straight up, any
building of sufficient size would then be larger on the top floor than
on the bottom floor, but this is a contradiction. QED

And a few refutations of established results:

Ptolemy (?) proposed the earth was round and proved it by figuring its
radius based on the angle the sun made with Alexandria on the same day
it was directly over another city (7.2 deg.). Flat Earthers insist that
this is only an assumption; if the earth was flat the experiment would
still yield meaningful results, since the system is then a right tri-
angle and the sun would therefore be 4,000 miles away.

And for all those who need visual proof and are satisfied with satellite
photos, Flat Earthers cite Einstein's general theory of relativity and
its proclaiming that light bends in the presence of massive objects;
thus what is actually flat appears to cameras as round. This phenomenon
also explains why ships appear to rise out of the horizon.

Finally, a story I read elsewhere: a researcher at some lab once got a
letter from a very distressed Flat Earther, who had heard that the
Soviets (I guess 1950s?) were going to detonate a nuclear bomb. Newton's
third law would then dictate that the (flat) earth would then tilt toward
the USSR, and everybody would slide off. The researcher wrote back that
all was well, and that we in U.S. of A. planned to detonate a similar
bomb at the same instant on OUR end of the world, thus cancelling the
torque the Soviet bomb created.
The researcher was given a dressing-down when the Flat Earther wrote
a letter of commendation and praise to the researcher's boss.

A fellow was following a truck in heavy traffic. Every block or so, when
they were stopped at a stop light, the driver of the truck would jump out
of the cab with a big stick and bang on the side of the cargo bay. He'd
then jump back into the cab in time to drive away when the signal changed.

The first fellow observed this for several miles, until he could stand it
no longer. The next time the truck driver jumped out with the stick, the

said, over the din of the banging, "but I am very curious; could you tell
me what you are doing?"  Without breaking rhythm, the truck driver replied,
"Sure, Mac. Ya see, this here's a six-ton truck but I've got eight tons of

I don't break an axle".

P__________________________________________________________________________
From: sirius@wam.umd.edu (The Human Neutrino = Linda Harden)

           IS THERE A SANTA CLAUS? (Spy Magazine, January 1990)

1) No known species of reindeer can fly. BUT there are 300,000 species of
living organisms yet to be classified, and while most of these are insects
and germs, this does not COMPLETELY rule out flying reindeer which only
Santa has ever seen.

2) There are 2 billion children (persons under 18) in the world. BUT since
Santa doesn't (appear) to handle the Muslim, Hindu, Jewish and Buddhist
children, that reduces the workload to 15% of the total - 378 million
according to Population Reference Bureau. At an average (census)rate of 3.5
children per household, that's 91.8 million homes. One presumes there's at
least one good child in each.

3) Santa has 31 hours of Christmas to work with, thanks to the different
time zones and the rotation of the earth, assuming he travels east to
west(which seems logical). This works out to 822.6 visits per second. This
is to say that for each Christian household with good children, Santa has
1/1000th of a second to park, hop out of the sleigh, jump down the chimney,
fill the stockings, distribute the remaining presents under the tree, eat
whatever snacks have been left, get back up the chimney, get back into the
sleigh and move on to the next house. Assuming that each of these 91.8
million stops are evenly distributed around the earth (which, of course, we
know to be false but for the purposes of our calculations we will accept),
we are now talking about .78 miles per household, a total trip of 75-1/2
million miles, not counting stops to do what most of us must do at least
once every 31 hours, plus feeding and etc. This means that Santa's sleigh
is moving at 650 miles per second, 3,000 times the speed of sound. For
purposes of comparison, the fastest man- made vehicle on earth, the Ulysses
space probe, moves at a poky 27.4 miles per second - a conventional
reindeer can run, tops, 15 miles per hour.

4) The payload on the sleigh adds another interesting element. Assuming
that each child gets nothing more than a medium-sized lego set (2 pounds),
the sleigh is carrying 321,300 tons, not counting Santa, who is invariably
described as overweight. On land, conventional reindeer can pull no more
than 300 pounds. Even granting that "flying reindeer" (see point #1) could
pull TEN TIMES the normal anoint, we cannot do the job with eight, or even
nine. We need 214,200 reindeer. This increases the payload - not even
counting the weight of the sleigh - to 353,430 tons. Again, for comparison
- this is four times the weight of the Queen Elizabeth.

5) 353,000 tons traveling at 650 miles per second creates enormous air
resistance - this will heat the reindeer up in the same fashion as
spacecrafts re-entering the earth's atmosphere. The lead pair of reindeer
will absorb 14.3 QUINTILLION joules of energy. Per second. Each. In short,
they will burst into flame almost instantaneously, exposing the reindeer
behind them, and create deafening sonic booms in their wake.The entire
reindeer team will be vaporized within 4.26 thousandths of a second. Santa,
meanwhile, will be subjected to centrifugal forces 17,500.06 times greater
than gravity. A 250-pound Santa (which seems ludicrously slim)would be
pinned to the back of his sleigh by 4,315,015 pounds of force.

In conclusion - If Santa ever DID deliver presents on Christmas Eve, he's
dead now.

                                REBUTTAL 1

From: hjiwa@nor.chevron.com Canonical List Of Holiday Humor
Rebuttal: (Jim Mantle, Waterloo Maple Software)

Come on, ya gotta believe! I mean, if you can handle flying furry animals,
then it's only a small step to the rest.

For example;

   1) As admitted, it is possible that a flying reindeer can be found. I
would agree that it would be quite an unusual find, but they might exist.

   2) You've relied on cascading assumptions. For example, you have assumed
a uniform distribution of children across homes. Toronto/Yorkville, or
Toronto/Cabbagetown, or other yuppie neighbourhoods, have probably less
than the average (and don't forget the DINK and SINK homes (Double Income
No Kids, Single Income No Kids)), while the families with 748 starving
children that they keep showing on Vision TV while trying to pick my pocket
would skew that 15% of homes down a few percent.

   3) You've also assumed that each home that has kids would have at least
one good kid. What if anti-selection applies, and homes with good kids tend
to have more than their share of good kids, and other homes have nothing
except terrorists in diapers? Let's drop that number of homes down a few
more percent.

   4) Santa would have to Fedex a number of packages ahead of time, since he
would not be able to fly into Air Force Bases, or into tower-controlled areas
near airports. He's get shot at over certain sections of the Middle East, and
the no-fly zones in Iraq, so he'd probably use DHL there. Subtract some more
homes.

   5) I just barely passed Physics and only read Stephen Hawking's book
once, but I recall that there is some Einsteinian Theory that says time
does strange things as you move faster. In fact, when you go faster than
the speed of light time runs backward, if you do a straight line
projection, connect the dots and just ignore any singularity you might find
right at the speed of light. And don't say you can't go faster than the
speed of light because I've seen it done on TV. Jean-Luc doesn't have
reindeer but he does have matter-antimatter warp engines and a holodeck and
that's good enough for me.
   So Santa could go faster than light, visit all the good children which
are not uniformly distributed by either concentration in each home or by
number of children per household, and get home before he left so he can
digest all those stale cookies and warm milk yech.

   6) Aha, you say, Jean-Luc has matter-antimatter warp engines, Santa only
has reindeer, where does he get the power to move that fast!
   You calculated the answer! The lead pair of reindeer will absorb 14.3
quintillion joules of energy. Per second. Each. This is an ample supply of
energy for the maneuvering, acceleration, etc, that would be required of the
loaded sleigh. The reindeer don't evaporate or incinerate because of this
energy, they accelerate. What do you think they have antlers for, fighting over
females? Think of antlers as furry solar array panels.

   7) If that's not enough, watch the news on the 24th at 11 o'clock. NORAD
(which may be one of the few government agencies with more than 3 initials
in it's name and therefore it must be more trustworthy than the rest)
tracks Santa every year and I've seen the radar shots of him approaching my
house from the direction of the North Pole. They haven't bombarded him yet,
so they must believe too, right?

Yet another rebuttal to the rebuttal:

                                REBUTTAL 2

Several key points are overlooked by this callous, amateurish "study."

   1) Flying reindeer: As is widely known (due to the excellent historical
documentary "Santa Claus is Coming to Town," the flying reindeer are not a
previously unknown species of reindeer, but were in fact given the power of
flight due to eating magic acorns. As is conclusively proven in "Rudolph
the Red-Nosed Reindeer" (a no punches pulled look at life in Santa's
village), this ability has bred true in subsequent generations of reindeer,
obviously the magic acorns imprinted their power on a dominant gene
sequence within the reindeer DNA strand.

   2) Number of households: This figure overlooks two key facts. First of
all, the first major schism in the Church split the Eastern Churches,
centered in Byzantium, from the Western, which remained centered in Rome.
This occurred prior to the Gregorian correction to the Julian calendar. The
Eastern churches (currently called Orthodox Churches) do not recognize the
Gregorian correction for liturgical events, and their Christmas is as a
result several days after the Western Churches'. Santa gets two shots at
delivering toys.
   Secondly, the figure of 3.5 children per household is based on the gross
demographic average, which includes households with no children at all. The
number of children per household, when figured as an average for households
with children, would therefore have to be adjusted upward. Also, the
largest single Christian denomination is Roman Catholic, who, as we all
know, breed like rabbits. If you don't believe me, ask my four brothers and
two sisters, they'll back me up. Due to the predominance of Catholics
within Christian households, the total number of households containing
Christian children would have to be adjusted downward to reflect the
overloading of Catholics beyond a standard deviation from the median.

   Also, the assertion that each home would contain at least one good child
would be reasonable enough if there were in fact an even 3.5 children per
household. However, since the number of children per household is
distributed integrally, there are a significant number (on the order of
several million) of one child Christian households. Even though only
children are notoriously spoiled and therefore disproportionately inclined
towards being naughty, since it's the holidays we'll be generous and give
them a fifty-fifty chance of being nice. This removes one half of the
single child households from Santa's delivery schedule, which has already
been reduced by the removal of the Orthodox households from the first
delivery run.

   3) Santa's delivery run (speed, payload, etc.): These all suffer from the
dubious supposition that there is only one Santa Claus. The name "Santa" is
obviously either Spanish or Italian, two ethnic groups which are both
overwhelmingly Catholic. The last name Claus suggests a joint German/Italian
background. His beginnings, battling the Burgermeister Meisterburger, suggest
he grew up in Bavaria (also predominantly Catholic). The Kaiser style helmets
of the Burgermeister's guards, coupled with the relative isolation of the
village, suggest that his youth was at the very beginning of Prussian influence
in Germany. Thus, Santa and Mrs. Claus have been together for well over one
hundred years. If you think that after a hundred years of living at the North
Pole with nights six months long that they remain childless, you either don't
know Catholics or are unaware of the failure rate of the rhythm method. There
have therefore been over five generations of Clauses, breeding like Catholics
for over one hundred years. Since they are Catholic, their exponential
population increase would obviously have a gain higher than the world
population as a whole. There have therefore been more than enough new Santas to
overcome the population increase of the world. So in fact, Santa has an easier
time of it now than he did when he first started out.

Santa dead, indeed; some people will twist any statistic to "prove" their
cynical theory.

Yet another rebuttal:
                                REBUTTAL 3

From: egreen@nyc.pipeline.com (Edward Green)

5) That's nonsense.  I repeated the calculation, and the correct figure is
17,500.03 times gravity.  How can we place belief when such an implausibly
high figure is accepted!  The entire concept is obviously deeply flawed and
arises from incorrect method!

Besides, Santa simply realizes all of his alternate quantum states at once.
 Everybody knows that.

People keep defending the existence of Santa Claus:

                                REBUTTAL 4

From:         Jerome Elisha <jpse57@gte.net>
Surely the 'esteemed' professional making the analysis means 'forces of
acceleration', and not "centrifugal forces" as stated.  Furthermore, to
accept the ability of reindeer to defy the law of gravity and then bind
them to the remaining laws of physics is an error in argument.

The assertion ignores empirical data - Santa does exist:  one can see
him often during the months leading up to the Big Day.  Indeed, it is a
frequent occurrence to see him on multiple street corners, or in front
of several businesses, at the same time.  Either A) Santa has many
helpers, or B) Santa is capable of numerous manifestations.  In either
case, the acceleration arguments above are not valid, since the
multiplicity of Santas (manifestations or helpers) could easily handle
smaller portions of the task with time left over for cookies and milk.

Arguments A) and B) are both are supported by the different guises he
sports in various countries (Santa Claus, Sinter Klaus, Kris Kringle, et
al.),
and by his acknowledged ability to "see you when you're sleeping; he
knows when you're awake".  The decision between A) or B) is left as a
proof for the student.

And yet another rebuttal:

                                REBUTTAL 5
From: Lorenzo Sadun <sadun@fireant.ma.utexas.edu>

I wrote this rebuttal to the physics of santa analysis back in 1993:

If you're going to criticise Santa Claus on physical grounds, you may at
least do it right.

The payload calculations are nonsense.  Adding, say, 1000 stops back at the
North Pole for reloading adds only a few percent to the entire distance
covered, while reducing the payload by a factor of 1000.  This is clearly
the way to go.

The nonuniform distribution of children has a tremendous effect on the
routing.  With sensible routing, the average distance from a good child to
the next good child is only a couple hundred feet in suburban conditions
(this is clearly higher in the country, but is much less in, say, New York
City).  With only .05 miles between average good children, Santa need only
travel at Mach 200, just a little faster than Ulysses.  This reduces the
force of air resistance by a factor of 200, and the power absorbed by the
reindeer by 3000.

(Of course, if Santa stops to give coal to bad children it could slow
things down a bit.  But it appears that increasing population has made
Santa give up that trick.  When was the last time you heard of anybody
getting a lump of coal?)

We all saw the pictures of a smart bomb falling through an Iraqi smokestack
during the Gulf War.  Clearly Santa uses the same technology for toys and
chimneys.  By dropping, say, 100 toys at a time from high altitude, Santa
can reduce his speed by another factor of 10.  While still supersonic, this
is now slightly less than orbital velocity, sparing Santa and his team the
trauma of extreme centrifugal force.

Santa's trip IS a remarkable feat of aeronautics, but please don't say it's
impossible.

Does anybody wish to make proof or disproof these assertions? -JV

From: Merv <mcripps2@home.com>
As a result of an overwhelming lack of requests, and with research help
from that renowned scientific journal SPY magazine (January, 1990) -- I am
pleased to present the annual scientific inquiry into Santa Claus.

The analysis you sent me about the death of Santa Claus, based on classical
physics, is seriously flawed owing to its neglect of quantum phenomena that
become significant in his particular case.  As it happens, the terminal
velocity of a reindeer in dry December air over the Northern Hemisphere
(for example) is known with tremendous precision.  The mass of Santa and
his sleigh (since the number of children and their gifts is also known
precisely, ahead of time, and the reindeer must weigh in minutes before the
flight) is also known with tremendous precision.  His direction of flight
is, as you say, essentially east to west.

All of that, when taken together, means that the momentum vector of
Mr. Claus and his cargo is known with incredible precision.  An elementary
application of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle yields the result that
Santa's location, at any given moment on Christmas Eve, is highly
imprecise.  In other words, he is "smeared out" over the surface of the
earth, analogous to the manner in which an electron is "smeared out" within
a certain distance from the nucleus in an atom.  Thus he can, quite
literally, be everywhere at any given moment.

In addition, the relativistic velocities which his reindeer can attain for
brief moments make it possible for him, in certain cases, to arrive at some
locations shortly before he left the North Pole.  Santa, in other words,
assumes for brief periods the characteristics of tachyons.  I will admit
that tachyons remain hypothetical, but then so do black holes, and who
really doubts their existence any more?

Yours sincerely,

From: eugene@dynagen.co.za (Eugene Griessel)

Physics refutes this.  From "New Scientist" December 1989:

In Search of Schrodinger's Reindeer.

With the festive season upon us, many scientific minds will yet again
be attempting to solve that perennial chestnut, the Travelling Santa
Problem (or TSP). This problem was first brought to our attention by
the child  prodigy, Vernon P. Templeman, in his seminal paper "Please
may I have a bike for Christmas, Daddy" (J. Appl. Window Shopping,
December 1988, vol 7, p 1-122).

In simple terms, the problem boils down to one of speed. How can
Father Christmas visit the homes of all the children in the world in a
single night, albeit 24 hours long? Templeman demonstrated that the
classical (sequential) explanation forces us to invoke
faster-than-light travel, which is somewhat at odds with current
thinking.

Thus, he argued, we should infer that the Father Christmas effect does
not really exist. This contentious hypothesis was the subject of much
debate at a recent  symposium held at the Santa Fe Institute for
Present Research.

Our initial thoughts were that Templeman had over-estimated the size
of the problem, forgetting that Santa only visits good children. This
would reduce the number of visits by a factor of order 10^9.

However, a simple back-of-the-lab-coat calculation shows that this
renders the problem no more tractable. This threw suspicion on the use
of classical physics.  At this stage, the teachings of our old mentor,
Erwin Schroedinger, came back to us ("Famous people what we claim to
have known, honest", by Matthew Davies and Martin Slaughter, Annals of
Physics, 1983, vol 12, pp 379-381). From a detailed study of reported
phenomena, it became apparent that Santa shared many of the
characteristics of elementary particles, suggesting a quantum
mechanical  interpretation of his behaviour. We have since developed
this theory, and are confident that a quantum mechanical model of
Santa Claus allows many of his observed  properties to be explained,
and several  interesting predictions to be made.

Clearly, viewing Santa as a waveform removes the apparent paradox of
his "presence" being measured in several locations within a short
interval of  time. As the waveform collapses down  in a specific
location (attracted, we suggest, by the Goodness Quantum  number of
the recumbent child) it becomes  perfectly valid to state that a
"visitation"  has occurred.

However, our calculations suggest that the process of measurement (for
example, turning on the bedroom light) will almost certainly lead to a
localised, space-time instability which, in turn, will cause the
waveform to relax and render detection almost impossible.

Once again, this ties in with the  experimental evidence that Father
Christmas is rarely caught delivering. Indeed, on those few occasions
when a sighting has been claimed in the literature ("Mummy, mummy,
there's a strange man in my bedroom" by S. T. U. Peedo, Journal of
Sleepless Nights, 1979, vol 5, p 35), closer scrutiny has often
revealed it to be an imposter wearing a red cloak and beard.

Moreover, the quantum mechanical model predicts that energies involved
in a waveform collapse will result in the  emission of a jet of
sub-atomic particles. Studies of bedroom carpets in the vicinity of
alleged sightings, using an X-mass spectrometer, have often revealed
evidence of mince pion activity; though these have usually been
Hoovered up.

One of the most appealing aspects of our theory is the manner in which
it allows the most likely sites for visitation to be  estimated. These
may be identified from the first derivative of the expectation value
as:

  d (Spot)       |
-----------------|
  d (Fireplace)  | night

It turns out that the distribution of  household chimneys is exactly
that required to act as a diffraction grating for objects of Santa's
predicted wavelengths, focusing the zeroth order onto the bedroom
floor below ("Chimchimmeny, chimchinny, chimchin cheroo", by Bert,
Mar. Popp. 1969).

Yet another predication which agrees with commonly reported
observations  concerns the Christmas Stocking effect. Within
the general theory, the stocking would be expected to act as an
infinite potential well, momentarily capturing the Santa waveform.
The resonance within the stocking is predicted to transfer energy from
any batteries within the well (causing them to run out by Boxing Day)
before collapsing back down to a new ground state characterised by
a tangerine in the toe.

Apart from the successes reported above, the theory makes a number of
predictions about rather low probability events; that is, events
expected to occur in fewer than one hundred homes in the world each
year (for example, a full night's sleep for parents of under-8s; no
clothes given as presents; fairy lights still working from last year).
In order to collect the huge volume of data needed to assess these
rare events, we have decided to appeal to the scientific community for
help.

Well as the few observations available fit the theory, a detailed
experiment to provide quantltatlve.support is now necessary. This
will require a vast amount of data to be collected with observations
from as many global locations as possible.

New Scientist's readers are, therefore, asked to maintain a Yule log
of the events in their domestic laboratories and to send their
results to the authors via the magazine.

Participants are requested to make a note of thefollowing:

(1) Their children's Goodness Quantum number;
(2) The approximate dimensions of their bedroom;
(3) Whether Santa visits and, if so, at what time;
(4) Their address and galactic bspace coordinates (or postcode);
(5) Any evidence of Charm or Strangeness;
(6) Whether Santa is seen to be spinning (needed to check the "No L"
theory)
(7) The number of presents left;
(8) The colour of his reindeer's nose (often quoted as red when seen
moving away at speed, but unknown in its rest frame).

On a note of caution, participants are urged not to try to localise
Santa as the delta p. delta x equals or is greater than h
relationship suggests that the energies involved could demolish a
timber frame building.

At a time when Europe is leading the world in fundamental physics
research we hope that this knotty problem can be resolved with this
experiment. The Americans are not far behind, with Senate
approval for the $12 trillion Turkey/ Anti-Turkey Synchronous
Santatron. Let us make sure we cook their goose before
they foil our efforts.

From: "Brian Hansen" <iblis@rrk.kollegienet.dk>
It is very clear to me, that Santa is not dead. He is unemployed.

In the Evangelium of Markus, it states that it is harder for a rich man to
get into heaven, than it is for at camel to pass through the eye of a
needle. Today, we are by far more rich, than they were when the bible was
written.
P__________________________________________________________________________

                        HEAVEN IS HOTTER THAN HELL

The temperature of Heaven can be rather accurately computed.  Our
authority is Isaiah 30:26, "Moreover, the light of the Moon shall be as
the light of the Sun and the light of the Sun shall be sevenfold, as
the light of seven days."  Thus Heaven receives from the Moon as much
radiation as we do from the Sun, and in addition 7*7 (49) times as much
as the Earth does from the Sun, or 50 times in all.  The light we
receive from the Moon is one 1/10,000 of the light we receive from the
Sun, so we can ignore that ... The radiation falling on Heaven will
heat it to the point where the heat lost by radiation is just equal to
the heat received by radiation, i.e., Heaven loses 50 times as much
heat as the Earth by radiation.  Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law for
radiation, (H/E)^4 = 50, where E is the absolute temperature of the
earth (300K), gives H as 798K (525C).  The exact temperature of Hell
cannot be computed ... [However] Revelations 21:8 says "But the
fearful, and unbelieving ... shall have their part in the lake which
burneth with fire and brimstone."  A lake of molten brimstone means
that its temperature must be at or below the boiling point, 444.6C.  We
have, then, that Heaven, at 525C is hotter than Hell at 445C.

The following is one of Dr. Schalmbaugh's Final Test questions for
May 1997.  (Dr. Schalmbaugh,  University of Oklahoma School of Chemical
Engineering, is  known for asking questions such as this on his
final exams.)

May 1997, Momentum, Heat and Mass Transfer II Final Exam Question:

"IS HELL EXOTHERMIC OR ENDOTHERMIC?  Support your answer with truth."

Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law
or some variant. One student, however, wrote the following:

First, we postulate that if souls exist, then they must have some
mass.  If they do, then a mole of souls can also have a mass.  So,
at what rate are souls moving into hell and at what rate are souls
leaving?  I think that  we can safely assume that once a soul gets
to hell, it will not leave.

Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for souls entering hell, lets look
at the different religions that exist in the world today. Some of
these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion,
you will go to hell.  Since there are more than one of these religions
and people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project
that all people and all souls go to hell.  With birth and death rates
as they are, we can expect the number of souls in hell to increase
exponentially.

Now, we look at the rate of change in volume in hell.  Boyle's Law
states that in order for the temperature and pressure in hell to stay
the same, the ratio of the mass of souls and volume needs to stay
constant.

Case 1: If hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which
souls enter hell, then the temperature and pressure in hell will
increase until all hell breaks loose.

Case 2: If hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of
souls in hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until hell
freezes over.

So which is it?  If we accept the postulate given to me by Theresa
Banyan during my freshman year, "it will be a cold night in hell
before I sleep with you"  and take into account the fact that I still
have NOT succeeded in having sexual relations with her, then case 2
cannot be true.

Thus, hell is exothermic.

The student, Tim Graham, got the only A.
P__________________________________________________________________________
There are no physicists in the hottest parts of hell, because the
existence of a "hottest part" implies a temperature difference, and any
marginally competent physicist would immediately use this to run a heat
engine and make some other part of hell comfortably cool.  This is
obviously impossible. -- Richard Davisson
P__________________________________________________________________________
From: ekstrom@pacificrim.net (Philip A. Ekstrom)

Whatever the temperature of hell, I can prove that it is isothermal.

We must begin by assuming that there is at least one physicist in hell.  Most
of us can think of a particular example.

Now assume that some portion of hell is out of equilibrium, a bit hotter or
colder than the rest.  If so, then that physicist would build a heat engine
and extract some energy, and use that energy to run a refrigerator.  He would
cool some other part of hell down until it was comfortable.

But it is contrary to the definition of hell that any part of it should be
comfortable.  QED.

SCHRODINGER'S CAT BOX

A fun project is the Schrodinger's Cat Box.  You need a mild source of
radioactivity (I use scrapings from old "luminous" watches I get at flea
markets).  I make a box out of plywood except that two sides are small
celled Nomex honeycomb (<.125") cut to three inch thickness.  One honeycomb
side is covered with onion skin paper and the other is left open.  A strong
light is positioned outside the open celled honeycomb wall and is directed
into the box.  The radioactive scrapings are smeared across the light lens
with a bit of glue.  Inside the box I put the sensor to a Geiger counter
(borrow one from your local high school).  The counter is connected to a
fast relay which, when closed by an alpha particle from the scrapings,
lights the light.  Now, a small, live animal (cat) is placed into the box.
One stands behind the onion skin paper side of the box and plugs in the
Geiger Counter.  With no light the alpha particles are few and are not
sufficient to turn on the light.  The light is switched the first time with
a switch which is in parallel with the relay.  Instantly you can see the
shadow of the animal on the onion skin paper.  Then, as the cat moves, the
light and rush of alpha particles turn the light on and off, strobe like,
and you can see that sometimes the animal is not there, or some part of him
is gone!  It's quantum uncertainty can be measured.  It proves that there
are two states for the animal (and everything else) -- existence and
non-existence.  No harm comes to the animal, by the way.

The Schrodingers Cat experiment in Quantum Physics:

Take one ordinary cat, one large box, a particle detector, a radiation
source, a bottle of cyanide gas. Hook up the detector so that if it detects
a particle from the radiation source, it will open the cyanide gas. Set it
up inside the box in such a way that there will be a 50% probability of a
particle being detected from the radiation source within a five minute
period. Add the cat to the box.

Theory says that the cat will enter a quantum state where it is 50% alive
and 50% dead until the experimenter looks inside the box. However, reality
teaches us that the severly pissed off cat cat WILL escape the box well
before the 5 minutes are up, attack the experimenter and depart just in
time for the severly lacerated experimenter to watch the hammer decend on
the cyanide bottle one inch from his nose.

(This just materialized on my desk one day. It's in my handwriting, so I
must have written it, though I'll deny it if I'm indicted. -AA)

The topic for today is quantum physics. Quantum physics was developed in
the 1930's, as a result of a bet between Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr, to
see who could come up with the most ridiculous theory and still have it
published. Most people agree that Bohr won hands down, although Einstein
did very well in the swimsuit competition.

One of the most important researchers in quantum physics is Werner
Heisenberg, a man with a wonderful sense of humor, who was always cracking
one-liners, like "delta-p times delta-x is less than h!" Ha! ha! What a
card! This is known as Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, which is closely
related to Goedel's Incompleteness Theorem, which says that some things are
true, but you can't prove them, like when my wife and I argue over whether
it's her turn to take out the garbage or not.

What Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle says is that if something is small
enough, you can't say anything about it. Anyone with the I.Q. of baking
powder immediately understood that this means that if you look at something
so small that you can't even *see* it, like my dog, Oscar Wilde's, brain,
then you obviously can't tell, say, what color it is.

But some people didn't get the joke, and decided to investigate this
principle further. They would gather and sit around all day, drinking beer
and performing "Gedankesexperimenten," or "Thank God we're theoretical
physicists so we don't have to get our hands dirty with particle
accelerators and other heavy machinery." The most famous of these is
Schroedinger's Cat, where several physicists kidnap Erwin Schroedinger's cat
Fluffy and lock it up in a box, along with a radioactive source such as
Cheez Doodles. Then they walk around with concerned expressions on their
faces, commenting about how they don't know what's going on inside the box.
This goes on until the cleaning lady discovers the box, opens it and tells
the physicists whether the cat is dead, or whether it has mutated into a
man-eating flea the size of Norway.

The point of this experiment is to show that uncertainty at the quantum
level can be detected in the macroscopic world and produce widespread
anxiety and paranoia. It also explains why paper clips just lie there while
you look at them, but as soon as you turn your back, they run away, giggling
wildly, and transform themselves into coat hangers.

Another famous researcher is Richard Feynman, who invented Feynman diagrams,
which are bunches of squiggly lines with greek letters next to them. The
way they were discovered was, one day, Hans Bethe came in to Feynman's
office to say that some of the guys down in particle research were having a
jam session down by the cyclotron, and would Richard like to come over and
bring his bongos? Feynman was out, at the time, cracking a safe or
something, so Bethe tried to leave him a note. On the desk, he found one of
Feynman's daugter's kindergarten drawings. Bethe couldn't make head or tail
of it, and figured that if even he couldn't understand it, then it must be
something Terribly Clever, and promptly called it a Feynman diagram.

This was a major scientific breakthrough, and ever since, proud parents have
been hanging their children's Feynman diagrams on refrigerators with little
muon-shaped magnets, confident that their Little Darlings are developing
important scientific theories every day, because they are, after all, Gifted
Crank Unified Theories:  The CUTting edge of Fuzzy Science

Quite recently the Institute of Fuzzy Science has announced
the discovery of several bold new theories, providing a unified
explanation, or at least excuse, for a broad range of natural
phenomena.  These theories are both extremely ambitious in their
scope and modest in their assumptions.  Their main trait is that
they deduce a great deal from practically nothing.

The creation of Crank Unified Theories is an old and honorable
tradition, dating back to prehistoric times, when our ancient
ancestors looked around them and asked "How the heck did *this* all
get here?"  The process was lent considerable prestige by such
luminaries as Aristotle and Ptolemy, in the classical age, and
continues up to this day.  One recent idea by a worker outside the
Institute was Photon Mechanics, which postulated that all
fundamental particles were composed of photons.  In an attempt to
prove this, he tried to synthesize a meal from gamma rays.
Unfortunately, the food immediately propagated away at 299,000
kilometers per second, leaving critics of the light lunch
unsatisfied.

"Terrible," one physicist commented.  "Much too bland."  Others
seemed to agree.

The CUTs produced at the Institute of Fuzzy Science are
notable in that they all contradict each other, and sometimes
themselves.  Thus, few would argue that all, or even most, are
correct.  The most successful theory to date is that of Dr. Isaac M.
Woozy, commonly known as Woozy Theory.  Woozy Theory has
proven capable of predicting practically anything you put to it.

What is Woozy Theory?  In its simplest outlines, it is an
attempt to describe nature by unifying three separate realms of
observation:  General Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, and Scrabble.
By adopting a three pronged approach the theory is able to resolve
the apparent contradictions between each of the sub-theories.

"I believe that the problems of earlier researchers," stated Dr.
Woozy, "arose from treating the subjects piecemeal.  A unified
approach is required."  He cites difficulties with Superstring
Theory, Quantum Scrabble, and Scrabble in Curved Spacetime.  In
each case, he maintains, difficulties arose from neglecting a broad
class of other phenomena.  "My discovery was serendipitous," he
recalls.  "I'd been wrestling with various theories for weeks
without getting anywhere.  Finally, in my office, I picked up
Merzbacher's Quantum Mechanics in one hand and Misner, Thorne and
Wheeler's Gravitation in the other -- well, I touched it, anyway,
it's too heavy to lift.  Just as I was staring at both of them, my
Scrabble set fell from the top shelf and hit me on the head."

With the blow came illumination.  If one merely assumes that
Scrabble must exist, the rest of nature follows.  Gravity, for
example, is necessary to keep the pieces on the board.
Electromagnetism provides light, to see the letters with.  One
critic pointed out the possibility of magnetized pieces; Woozy
pondered for hours until he had resolved the conflict to his
satisfaction.

"One not only needs gravity to keep the pieces on the board," he
explained, "but also to provide an atmosphere, so the players can
breathe."  When the critic began to suggest pressure suits and
space colonies, Woozy silenced him with a skillfully thrown
paperweight.

"I take my work seriously," he declared.

Most exciting of all, Woozy theory provides the first coherent
explanation for the universe as a whole.  If Scrabble is necessary,
then so are players, and a universe to play in.  Woozy calls this the
"Really Strong" or "Scrabble" Anthropic Principle.  Humans (or at
least intelligent beings) are necessary, providing an order to
biological evolution which has been lacking since the failure of the
Chain of Being.  This also suggests that if aliens exist, they may
well play Scrabble.

"That doesn't mean that they will speak English, necessarily,"
Woozy added cautiously.  "There are foreign language versions,
after all.  And the point values may differ, somewhat."  He
suggested to SETI that they listen for very long range Play By Mail
games.  At present, his suggestion has not been acted on.
"They're just miffed that they didn't think of it," Woozy
sniffed.

Rival theories include unifying QFT and GR with chess or
checkers, or even tic-tac-toe.  While the originators of these
theories remain hopeful, Woozy is pessimistic.

"Those games are extremely difficult to unify with Quantum
Mechanics," Woozy explained, "since they lack an element of chance.
And tic-tac-toe doesn't even have pieces, so gravity is pretty
shaky as well.  Plus it's a drawn game (no pun intended).  Who'd
want to live in a universe that boring?"  Woozy also recalled an
early game of quantum chess:  "After about thirty moves, black was
both mated and not mated.  It made for terrible arguments."

Are these, or similar theories, the answer to the riddle of the
universe?  Most observers doubt it.  Still, as Dr. Woozy himself
points out, "What the heck, it keeps us off the streets."

The bartender, who is used to weird university types, always shrugs but

a particularly heart-wrenching plea into empty space, curiosity gets the
better of the bartender, and he says, "I apologize for my stupid questions,
but surely you know there is NEVER a woman sitting in that last stool. Why
do you persist in asking out empty space?"

The mathematician replies, "Well, according to quantum physics, empty space
is never truly empty. Virtual particles come into existance and vanish all
the time. You never know when the proper wave function will collapse and a
girl might suddenly appear there."

The bartender raises his eyebrows. "Really? Interesting. But couldn't you
just ask one of the girls who comes here every Friday if you could buy HER
a drink? Never know... she might say yes."

The mathematician laughs. "Yeah, right -- how likely is THAT to happen?"

1997-03-11	Scientific Correctness: Zippy Travel

Here is the report on our SCIENTIFIC CORRECTNESS SURVEY #2. The
question was:

Is faster-than-light travel possible?

This survey drew an onslaught of opinions.

The vote was a landslide (72%) for the YES side. Thus, another
controversy is put to rest. Henceforth, it will be scientifically
correct to believe that faster-than-light travel is possible.

Opinions ranged from positive to negative, and from simple ("Yes")
to hideously complex. While the results are interesting, the
variety of methods used to obtain them is dazzling.

Some readers used fuzzy logic:
I have never really believed that light actually goes at the speed
of light. Have we any proof? I worked out that it should go at
root two times the speed of light (c) making the constant itself
irrelevant.

Other readers used higher-level fuzzy logic:
This is an interesting question, coincidentally I was driving
through a Minnesota blizzard last week when my wife told me to
slow down because I was 'over driving my headlights.' I was so
excited I almost spilled my coffee because I thought that she
meant I was traveling faster than the speed of light, but then I
realized that she meant that because of the poor conditions, the
stopping distance for my car was greater than my visibility.

After reflection it is -c. Ergo at the instant of reflection, its
velocity is 0. When the vehicle passes the mirror, it goes faster
than light.
	--A. D. Snider
				*	*	*
Others relied on advanced theories:

Faster than light travel IS possible but only if you are facing
backwards.
	--Charles Belair

It depends on how fast the light is going.
	--Michael Castleman
				*	*	*
Some readers cited empirical evidence:

Of course. It is demonstrated every week in "Star Trek: The Next
Generation". They also demonstrate crystal power, telepathy,
reversal of the polarity of neutron fluxes in starboard power
couplings, and other facets of modern science.
	--Stephen Trier

No. No no no no no no. Most people think Star Trek has solved the
problem of faster-than-light travel. I am much more fascinated by
Star Trek's solution to the sound-in-a-vacuum problem.
	--Karen Lingel

"Yes!" E-mail uses delivery through electrical circuits, therefore
traveling at the speed of light (one of the reasons for its
popularity over the historically traditional US Postal "Service").
America OnLine uses these same electrical circuits. It is well
known that almost anything travels faster than AOL these days.
	--G. Borochoff
				*	*	*
Not everyone relied on intellectual arguments. Two readers,
Charlie Cerf and Peter Thorp, sent in variants of the same
classical argument:
	There was a young lady called Bright
	who could travel much faster than light.
	She departed one day
	in a relative way
	and returned on the previous night
				*	*	*
Practical experience, too, was useful in solving the question:

Of course faster-than-light travel is possible. However, the
probability that your luggage will wind up at the wrong
destination increases as the cube of the velocity.
	--Bob O'Hara

Yes. Faster than light travel is possible and can be readily
demonstrated by making the mistake of having two dates show up at
your place at the same time. I've done this and witnessed first
hand the flight, which happens so fast that you can't see it.
	--P. Hughes

Yes, but tickets must be purchased at least three weeks in advance
and a Saturday night stay is required.
	--Kristina Pawlikowski

After my cat decided it was play time at 3 AM, he was forcefully
accelerated from the bed. Quickly, his velocity reached the of
light resulting in a mid-air white hot flash of spontaneous
combustion (matter to energy.) Conversely, all internal energies
(neuroelectrical, biochemical, etc.) were converted to matter. A
strange ash covered the room, very similar to scoopable litter.
The other possibility is that he landed on my camera equipment and
has been hiding ever since.
	--Don Copeland
				*	*	*
Finally, one response defied categorization:
Of course, as a physics teacher I tell my students that faster-
than-light travel is impossible, but that's just to crush their
spirits.
	--LaNelle Ohlhausen

I happen to know something that is faster than light!!  :)

Darkness.

Try this:  lock yourself inside a darkened room.  Then, slowly, open the
door.  You can surely see the light coming in, but you can´t see the
darkness going out.  That´s how fast it is!!!

(This is an amazing result, since darkness is known to be heavier than
light: just ask any diver -- they will tell you that the deeper you go, the
darker it gets.  Darkness sinks, while light floats).

From: "riley" <riley@ctcweb.net>

That theory is technically incorrect, the dark is not actually leaving the
room.  Instead it is being compressed into an infinitely small space in the
corner of the room.  This also explains why the sun heats up the earth so
well; all the dark in the world is being compressed into a singularity,
this process creates an immese amount of heat, especially on the equator
where the direct sun rays cause the greatest compression.

Q: What would happen if the speed of light were only sixty miles per hour?

A: As we approach the speed of light, the aging process slows down. So, if
the speed of light were sixty miles per hour, we would have even more
people speeding, especially older people trying to stay young. As a matter
of fact, physics would demand that we go faster than the speed of
light. The safest thing is to drive at a steady sixty to keep time and the
highway patrol off our necks.  Airplanes would become obsolete in this slow
light world, because you would be going so fast, relatively speaking, that
you'd be back before you even left. This would make business trips
unnecessary and lead to economic collapse.  So, to answer your question,
life, if the speed of light were sixty miles per hour, would be youthful,
fast, and dark.  -- Ask Dr. Science

Dear Dr. Science
      Why is the speed of light only 186,000 miles per second?  Can'[t
science do better than this?

       "Yes, you're right.  It's a disgrace light only goes a measly
186,000 miles per second, but physicists are working on this problem.
There's already a prototype vehicle that goes 200,000 miles per second, but
the headlights shine at only 186,000 miles per second.  This is equivalent
to driving down the freeway the wrong way with the headlights not only out
but actually chasing you down the road. This is why so many scientists
today no longer own a driver's licence. "

"How about this one?

It was late evening at the home of Wayne Throop and the gang were gathered.

There was Tom Roberts the energic brilliant technician, Nathan Urban the
rebelious outsider, Paul Andersen the great philosoph and Ande the real
deal.

This night they all were gathered to drink some vine and to watch just
another superb episode of X-archives.

Having so many brilliant mathematical minds brought together, it was
obviously impossibe to avoid discussions that handled some of the paradoxes
in the great theories of Einstein (SR and GR).

Wayne the deardevil in the gang kept quiet the whole evening, and wasn't
real in his usual chearfull mode. Tom turned to Wayne and asked him.

- What's up Wainie?

Wayne looked up, with a serious face studying the members of team-SR, he
uttered with low voice.

- I had this strange conversation with Ryker last night, he told me that
things appear longer not shorter when objects travel at high relative speed
to the observer, this really can't be the case can it?

- Of course not said Paul Andersen the great philosoph, this is not
according to SR and the "will of Einstein".

- Don't haste to any conclusion without having some experimental facts
verified upon your feets said Tom Roberts the mighty technician.

An intensive discussion was at hand, but it suddenly ended when Nathan
Urban and Ande the real deal suddenly proposed.

- Let's do a real experiment we bring in our bicycles to Waynes bathroom
and use his old car transmission.

-Why?  Asked Wayne.

- If we just could borrow your lucky dollar for a moment Wayne, and the
flashlight that Tom use for dark nights. Then we could transmit the energy
generated of us on the bicycles to make the luckydollar rotate, of course
we have to fetch the flashlight upon it said Nathan Urban!

Everybody felt and new, that this was just another excellent idea, created
within the great mind of Ande the real deal.

After some tedious work with the bicycles, all things was settled and the
gang were ready for the big show, Wayne the experimental executive and
observer, dropped the light.......

The muscles of the gang started to pump on the pedals and their muscles
were stretched beyond their limits, with all that work going on the dollar
slowly started to rotate with the flashlight sending it's white light thru
the empty space of Waynes bathroom.

Some time in the work with connecting the bicycles to the transmission
Wayne got the wonderfull idea to use an old revolv gauge with this he could
measure the revolves per second of the dollar .

Measuring the gauge Wayne could se 5 - 10 - 20 and the light slowly started
to stretch out, but the muscles of the gang just kept on working 100 - 200
- 1000 - 2000 - 5000 - 9000 - 9300 and the light started to form the shape
of an open circle, but then Wayne suddenly shouted stop, stop with a
hysterical voice. At first no one noticed him due to the effort and
restrain put in the pounding of the pedals, the gauge just went higher 9600
- 9800 - 9900 then Wayne scream STOP IN THE NAME OF EINSTEIN STOP,
everybody stoped pounding instantly!

Except for Tom the mighty he's muscles just kept pounding, and the gauge
showed 9950 - 9970 -9990- 9995. A fearless roar could be heard from Wayne
standing up,

starting to move in an incredible speed against Tom giving him an old
fashioned

highschool football tackle,that put him out of the seat of the bike.

Someone turned on the light and all looked in an suprised manner in the
direction of Wayne.

Tom said laying on the floor, what's going on Wayne?

- Wayne: I just realized what we were doing rotating that dollar, do you
know that a pulsar rotate with roughly 10000 revolves per second, there
some GR to consider doing this things at a higher speed!

They all looked at each other and said with common voice, ooooh that was a
close one.

The rest of the evening was spent talking about what really would have
happen if Wayne hadn't been able to stop Tom before he had turn the dollar
into a singularity.  (Someone with great philosophical knowledge even
proposed that Wayne had been faster then light that evening ;).

Suddenly, their chearfull conversation came to an end, it was the lead
music to

X-archives that started to play, Nathan Urban instinctly looked at his
watch, and realized that it had slowed 2 minutes. At comparing their
watches this evening they all knew what had happen, for a single moment
they all had been trapped by the mighty Tom Roberts at the edge of the
singularity, in a no mans land only the incredible effort of Wayne had
manage to bring them back, maybe he had moved faster then light afterall.

Since that day they all felt a great gratetude against Wayne, and felt that
he deserved a new nickname "Wayne the fastone".

I do believe that everyone could enjoy this story, no hard feeling SR! "

  Hillary Clinton, when in the White House, pouted so much to Bill that
there was so little that was relative to her that he, by executive order,

her.  As usual to the Big Government State, things got out of hand and
Hillary's own personal little relative spacetime universe accelerated out
of control in spacetime expansion so fast that it is now between 12 and 15
billion light years older and wider than the American government ever
intended it to be.

  The story goes that a 1-dimensional mathematician and physicist created a
flat universe meant to be flatly relative to Flatland an instant in
Flatland time ago and, as usual to Toon Town cartoon creations that always
blow themselves up out of control, it has been accelerating so fast in

=2.12 MEASURE THE HEIGHT OF A BUILDING WITH HELP OF A BAROMETER

For every problem, there are probably a thousand solutions.  The trick is
to find one you can use.  So, if you ever need to measure the height of a
building with a barometer, here are some methods you can try.

                           THE BAROMETER FABLE

(This seems to be the original story.  If you wish to see many solutions,
you can go to the next item.)

The following essay is frequently referred to, and often reprinted in
textbooks on writing. I recall it was also reprinted in one of the Project
Physics supplementary readers. Few people recall its source, or its author.

As a bit of humor it is nicely constructed. As a parable with a moral, it
falls flat. What is the author's point, one wonders? Is it an argument
against a particular kind of pedantry in teaching? Is it a demonstration
that exam questions can be subject to multiple interpretations? Is it an
example of how a clever student can find ingenious ways to answer a
question?

Just what is the difference between exploring `the deep inner logic of the
subject' and teaching `the structure of the subject'. Calandra doesn't
make that difference clear, yet his student seems not to like the first,
but would rather have the second.

The title (which most people forget) is a clue. Medieval scholastics were
fond of debating such meaningless questions as "How many angels can dance
on the point of a pin," "Did Adam have a navel," and "Do angels defecate."
The emerging sciences replaced such `scholarly' debates with
experimentation and appeals to observable fact. Calandra seems to be
suggesting that "exploring the deep inner logic of a subject in a pedantic
way" is akin to the empty arguments of scholasticism. He compares this to
the `new math', so much in the news in the 60s, which attempted to replace
rote memorization of math with a deeper understanding of the logic and
principles of mathematics, and he seems to be deriding that effort also. So
it still seems to me that we get no clear and useful message from this
essay.

On almost every level, this essay falls apart on critical analysis. I
wonder why it has become such a legend in the physics community?

                             A Modern Parable
                          by Alexander Calandra
                      Saturday Review, Dec 21, 1968.

Some time ago I received a call from a colleague who asked if I would
be the referee on the grading of an examination question. He was about
to give a student a zero for his answer to a physics question, while
the student claimed he should receive a perfect score and would if the
system were not set up against the student: The instructor and the
student agreed to submit this to an impartial arbiter, and I was
selected.

I went to my colleague's office and read the examination question:
"Show how it is possible to determine the height of a tall building
with the aid of a barometer."

The student had answered: "Take a barometer to the top of the
building, attach a long rope to it, lower the barometer to the street
and then bring it up, measuring the length of the rope. The length of
the rope is the height of the building."

I pointed out that the student really had a strong case for full
credit since he had answered the question completely and correctly. On
the other hand, if full credit was given, it could well contribute to
a high grade for the student in his physics course. A high grade is
supposed to certify competence in physics, but the answer did not
confirm this. I suggested that the student have another try at
answering the question I was not surprised that my colleague agreed,
but I was surprised that the student did.

I gave the student six minutes to answer the question with the warning
that the answer should show some knowledge of physics. At the end of
five minutes, he had not written anything. I asked if he wished to
give up, but he said no. He had many answers to this problem; he was
just thinking of the best one. I excused myself for interrupting him
and asked him to please go on. In the next minute he dashed off his
answer which read:

"Take the barometer to the top of the building and lean over the edge
of the roof. Drop that barometer, timing its fall with a stopwatch.
Then using the formula S = ½at², calculate the height of the building.

At this point I asked my colleague if he would give up. He conceded,
and I gave the student almost full credit.

In leaving my colleague's office, I recalled that the student had said
he had many other answers to the problem, so I asked him what they
were. "Oh yes," said the student. "There are a great many ways of
getting the height of a tall building with a barometer. For example,
you could take the barometer out on a sunny day and measure the height
of the barometer and the length of its shadow, and the length of the
shadow of the building and by the use of a simple proportion,
determine the height of the building."

"Fine," I asked. "And the others?"

"Yes," said the student. "There is a very basic measurement method
that you will like. In this method you take the barometer and begin to
walk up the stairs. As you climb the stairs, you mark off the length
of the barometer along the wa]l. You then count the number of marks,
and this will give you the height of the building in barometer units.
A very direct method."

"Of course, if you want a more sophisticated method, you can tie the
barometer to the end of a string, swing it as a pendulum, and
determine the value of `g' at the street level and at the top of the
building. From the difference of the two values of `g' the height of
the building can be calculated."

Finally, he concluded, there are many other ways of solving the
problem. "Probably the best," he said, "is to take the barometer to
the basement and knock on the superintendent's door. When the
superintendent answers, you speak to him as follows: "Mr.
Superintendent, here I have a fine barometer. If you tell me the
height of this building, I will give you this barometer."

At this point I asked the student if he really did know the
conventional answer to this question. He admitted that he did, said
that he was fed up with high school and college instructors trying to
teach him how to think, using the "scientific method," and to explore
the deep inner logic of the subject in a pedantic way, as is often
done in the new mathematics, rather than teaching him the structure of
the subject. With this in mind, he decided to revive scholasticism as
an academic lark to challenge the Sputnik-panicked classrooms of
America.

Bob Pease (Nat.Semi.) records the story of the Physics student who
got the following question in an exam:

"You are given an accurate barometer, how would you use it
to determine the height of a skyscraper ?"

1: He answered: "Go to the top floor, tie a long piece of string to the
barometer, let it down 'till it touches the ground and measure the
length of  the string".

The examiner wasn't satisfied, so they decided to interview the guy:

"Can you give us another method, one which demonstrates your knowledge
of Physics ?"

2: "Sure, go to the top floor, drop the barometer off, and measure how
long before it hits the ground......"

"Not, quite what we wanted, care to try again ?"

3: "Make a pendulum of the barometer, measure its period at the bottom,
then measure its period at the top......"

"..another try ?...."

4: "Measure the length of the barometer, then mount it vertically on the
ground on a sunny day and measure its shadow, measure the shadow of the
skyscraper....."

"....and again ?...."

5: "walk up the stairs and use the barometer as a ruler to measure the
height of the walls in the stairwells."

14: Here's one no-one seems to have thought of :
1) Build a sandpit (full of sand, OK?) at the bottom of the building.
2) Rake the sand flat.
3) Drop the barometer from the top of the building into the sand.
4) Measure the average diameter of the crater thus created.
5) From the answer to (4), the mass of the barometer and the
   properties of the sand (viscosity?) calculate its impact speed
   and thus the height from which it was dropped.

Also has the advantage that you may get your barometer back intact if:
a) The building is small.
b) The sand is soft.
c) The barometer is light and strong.

15: 1) Borrow one of those fancy two channel digital oscilloscopes from
somebody's lab when they aren't looking.
2) Connect a microphone to each channel. Place one microphone on ground
level. Call it "A".
3) Place other microphone "B" at top of building, directly over the first
microphone. Note that you may need a lot of cable.
4) Place barometer as close to A as possible.
5) Set scope to trigger on channel A.
6) Whack barometer once with hammer or suitable object. The purpose of
this is to make a nice, sharp impulse.
7) Measure the difference in arrival time of the impulse in each channel.
This is how long it took the sound to travel to the top of the building.
The speed of sound is approximately 1 foot per millisecond under most
conditions, so we can find the distance travelled by the pulse and thus
the height of the building.

Now don't even get me started about using a microphone, an oscilloscope
and audible "clicks" to make an acoustical motion detector. :)

Except for the trivial method (2), there are other ways to use dropping
the barometer:
P__________________________________________________________________________
From:         nce@liverpool.ac.uk (Dr N.C. Eastmond)

16: Drop the barometer off the building onto someones head, killing them
outright. Wait for the next day's papers and read the part where is says "A
man (39) was killed yesterday when a scientist (26) dropped a barometer
from the top of an [x] foot building".

17: If it's a _tall_ building, one could drop the barometer, measure how much
its length had changed when it reached the bottom, work out the speed from
the relativistic dilation, and form that nd knwon gravitational acceleration
calculate the height..
P__________________________________________________________________________
From: Gabriel Krabbe <satan@bofh.studfb.unibw-muenchen.de>
18: Actually, you don't have to drop it to use relativity.just hold it
parallel to your speed vector (as you rotate with the world) and measure
the length.  do this at the top and at the bottom of the building; at the
top, being further from the centre of the world, the speed is greater and
can be determined by the dilatation of the length of the baro- meter. from
there, it's easy to find out just how much further from the centre you are;
this figure being the height of the building.

2) Spill the alcohol over a heap of wood, paper and other inflammable
stuff in the cellar of the building in question.
3) Ignite.
4) Get out.
5) Listen to a local station on your radio.

20:
1) Measure the length of the barometer.
2) Borrow the scaffolding from the window washers.
3) Place the bottom of the barometer on the ground and make a
 pencil mark on the building at the top of the barometer.
4) Raise the scaffolding a bit to facilitate barometer and pencil
 manipulation.
5) Place the bottom of the barometer at the pencil mark on the
 building from step 3 and make a mark on the building at the top of the
 barometer.
6) Repeat steps 4 and 5 until you reach the top of the building.
 Be sure to count the pencil marks as you go.  If at the top of the
 building, you end up with the barometer sticking up above the building
 then you must follow the special steps noted later and add that to your
 answer.
7) Multiply the number of barometer lengths by the length of the
 barometer to get the building height.

*****SPECIAL STEPS NOTED HERE*****

        s1) Holding the end of the barometer at the top of the last full
barometer length mark, rotate the other end of the barometer until it is
in line with the top of the building.

        s2) Measure the angle between verticle and the barometer.

        s3) Take the cosine of that angle.

        s4) Take the answer to s4 and add that to the number of full
barometer lengths measured and multiply by the length of the barometer.

**********************************

Note: For best results, always hold the barometer vertically.

21: (Aneroid barometers only) Lie the barometer on its back on the ground.
Bounce a laser off the glass front and time how long that takes. Subtract
the thickness of the barometer.

22: (Mercury barometers only) Drain the mercury out and put it in a bowl.
Bounce a laser off the surface of the mercury, etc. etc. etc. Again,
subtract the height of the surface.

3. Measure the time difference between step 2. and the other end
   of the glass tube touching the ground with a high-precision
   timing device.
4. Calculate the height of the building using the known viscosity

24: Run a transparent tube up the side of the building. Fill it with water,
seal the top and open the bottom inside a reservoir of water. I.e.
effectively make a water barometer - just like a mercury barometer, but
with water instead of the mercury.

Wait for a day when the water level matches the height of the building, and
read off the atmospheric pressure on your original barometer. Calculate the
height of water that this atmospheric pressure can support.

Unless your building is pretty close to 10 meters high, you may have to wait
a long time.

2)  Any sizeable pieces should be pulverized into pebbles and dust.
3)  The height of the building should be zero.  If not, repeat step 2.

27: Remove the glass pipe from the barometer. Attach one end to an arrow and
the other to the top of the building. Evenly heat up the middle of the tube
to red heat and fire the arrow at the ground with a bow.
Measure the width of the extended glass tube at several points and average.
Knowing the original width, work out the distance travelled by the arrow.
Measure the distance of the arrow from the base of the building.
Use trigonometry to calculate the height of the building.

28: As a quick check, using the mercury you removed from the barometer:
Measure the temperature of the mercury at the top of the building, and put
it in a perfectly insulating container. Drop it off the building and measure
the temperature of the mercury after it has landed. Calculate the energy
gained and therefore the height of the building.

32: Tie a copper barometer to a copper wire of known diameter.  Lower
barometer from roof until it just rests on the ground.  Apply a
known voltage between the barometer and the end of the wire at root
level.  Measure current flowing between these two points and divide
this number into the voltage, giving you the resistance of the
barometer/wire combination.  Subtract the barometer's resistance and
use the resistance of the wire to determine its length.  Add back in
the height of the barometer.

Also, I'd like to see some answers formulated using a bungee jumping
barometer.  Possibly using the thickness of the bungee cord with the
barometer at ground level, maybe using the barometer weight necessary
to stretch the bungee cord all the way to the ground, etc...

Every meteorological observation site should have at least one
bungee jumping barometer.  At least.

36: Heres my silly [1] attempt at answering the question of how tall a
building is, using a barometer. One can easily find the height of a
building, simply by finding its top, and working from there.

Find a person with vertigo. (fear of heights)

Give them the barometer.

Tell them to put it on top of the building.

we have several measurements, which can then be cross referenced to
determine the height of the building.

1. Measure the volume of the sound caused by the persons knees
knocking together. The taller the building, the louder the knocking.
This should be standardised first, by testing  the sound produced for
buildings of known height.

2. attach electrodes to your subject. measure the EEG reading at the
moment immediately after placing the barometer on top of the building.
(ie, the moment they look down) amplitude of waves indicates anxiety.
Again, standardisation should be done to ensure accuracy. [2]

3. Measure the depth of the crater created when they land, after
having seen how high they were when they put the barometer on top of
the building.

activated.  Put an audiometer at the top of the building to stop the
stopwatch when the audiometer is activated (at least activated higher than
the backround noise already present).  Determine from there the speed of
sound (for that particular day) and therefore determine the top of the

38:I think the best procedure must be:

b) Locate a student waiting for this test.

b) Impose as a physics professor (wear silly clothes, talk funny,
mess up your hair, etc) and lure the student into a separate room.

c) Show the barameter you brought with you to the student and ask him
the following question: "You are given an accurate barometer, how would
you use it to determine the height of a skyscraper ?". Try to squeeze as
many answer out of him as possible.

d) If you didn't get any useful answers from c), then try to post the

39: Find a barometer with heights of local buildings on it
Go to all the local gift shops. Look for a fancy souvenir barometer,
the kind which shows important local landmarks. Find one which shows
the heights of local buildings and considers this building important
enough to be listed. Use this barometer.

40: Drop the barometer on the roof and on the ground
Hold the barometer straight in front of you and drop it. Measure, very
carefully, how long it takes to hit the ground. Go up on the roof and
hold the barometer in the same position. Drop it and measure, again
very carefully, how long it takes to hit the roof. Since gravity falls
off as the square of the distance from the centre of the planet, you
can use the difference in times to calculate the height of the
building relative to the distance from the base of the building to the
centre of the planet. The local library can provide you with the
distance to the centre of the planet in the required units.

Note: The ratio of the times is the same as the ratio of the distances
from the drop points to the centre of the planet.

41:  Drop (and shatter) the mercury barometer at the base of the buidling
on a windless day. Measure the increase in the mercury vapour
concentration at the top of the building. Solve the diffusion equation
to determine the distance from the shattered barometer to the top of
the building.

42: Place the barometer on the ground floor of the building. Seal all the
building's doors and windows. Fill the building with water. Read the
pressure measurement from the barometer. This gives the weight of a column
of water the same height as the building. Use this and the ratio of the
density of mercury to the density of water to calculate the height of the
building.

Note: It is common courtesy to evacuate the building before using this
technique.

43: If you have access to an airless world, take the building there. Throw
the barometer horizontally off the building. If the barometer hits the
ground, retrieve it and try again, throwing harder. The objective is to
throw it hard enough to achieve a circular orbit. Once the barometer is in
orbit around the planet, you can measure the period of the orbit. Compare
this with the period of the orbit when you throw the barometer from the
base of the building. Use this ratio and Kepler's laws to determine the
height of the building (relative to the radius of the planet).

61: Tie a long piece of string to the barometer. Hold one end of the
string from the top of the building, so that the end of the barometer
barely clears the ground. Give the barometer a small displacement
and time its period as a compound pendulum.

62: Smash the barometer on the roof of the building and time how
long it takes for the mercury to drip down the wall of the building to
the ground. Use the known viscosity of mercury to find the velocity.

63: Throw the barometer horizontally off the building with a known
velocity (calibrate your throwing ability by timing and measuring
barometer throws on the ground). Use projectile motion to find the
height of the building once the distance the barometer lands from
the building is found.

64: Find a small, very efficient, very light electric motor. Weigh the
barometer. Use the motor to carry the barometer up the building.
Using a voltmeter and ammeter, calculate the work done by the
motor, and thus the gravitational potential difference between the top
and bottom of the building. Knowing g, find the height.

65: Go to the basement. Find a part of the basement such that
directly above you is solid brick until you reach the roof. Throw the
barometer at the ceiling of the basement, which is the floor of the
building. The barometer will most likely bounce off the floor. Repeat
n times, where n is a very large number. In a few trials, the
barometer will tunnel through the potential field of the bricks, and
appear on the top of the building. Calculate the percentage of trials
for which the barometer tunnels. Use the quantum tunneling
equation to calculate the length of the barrier, and thus the height of
the building. Note: this effect can be calibrated properly by finding
the likelyhood of the barometer tunneling through one brick.

66: Attach a copper wire to the top of the building, and attach the
other end to the ground. Smash the barometer and use one of the
shards of glass to cut the wire halfway up the building and
place an ammeter in series with the wire. Knowing the current
through the wire and the resistivity of copper, the potential
difference between the top of the building and the bottom of the
building can be found. This will be a gravitational potential
difference, not an electrical one, but the electrons don't know that.
Thus, since g is known, the height of the building can be found.

67: Find a large wooden rod a bit longer than the building is high.
Wrap an insulated copper wire around this rod at a uniform turn
density. Make the coil stop at the top and bottom of the building.
Run alternating current through the coil, measure current and
voltage, and determine the inductance of the coil. Place the
barometer in series with the coil so the resistance of the circuit is
enough to stop the wires from melting. With the inductance of the
coil and its turns per unit length and radius, the length of the
coil, and thus the height of the building, can be found.

68: Drop the barometer off the top of the building and measure the
radius of the resulting puddle of mercury.

69: Using a device that can propel an object at a known velocity
(such as a baseball pitching machine or a rail gun), find the escape
velocity of the barometer from the ground, after first having tied a
string to the barometer so it can be retrieved from deep space.
Repeat on the top of the building. The difference in escape velocity
energies gives the gravitational potential difference between the
ground and the roof, thus yielding the height.

70: Using the aforementioned pitching machine or rail gun, find the
velocity at which the barometer needs to be projected to reach the
roof from the ground.

71: Make a small hole in the barometer through which mercury drips
at a constant rate. Time this rate at the ground. Place the barometer
on the roof and observe the drip rate from the ground with
binoculars. The drip rate will be dilated, by general relativity, by a
factor which will give the difference in the curvature of space at the
bottom and top of the building. Knowing the mass and radius of the
earth and so on, the height of the building can be found.

72: THIS METHOD USES MORE THAN ONE BAROMETER: Pack
as many barometers as possible into the building until it undergoes
gravitational collapse and becomes a black hole. Knowing the
number of barometers used, the mass of this hole can be
calculated, and the Schwarzchild radius of the hole is thus half the
height of the building.

73: Find a barometer that uses a liquid with no surface tension
whatsoever (superfluid helium?). Break the barometer and spread
the liquid evenly over the surface of the building. Measure the depth
of the resulting liquid film. Knowing the volume of the barometer, this
gives the surface area of the building, which will give its height,
if its width and depth are known.

74: Stand on the roof of the building. Throw the barometer to a point
exactly on the horizon. Measure the distance from the bottom of the
building to the barometer. This gives the horizon distance at the top
of the building, thus giving its height above the ground.

75: Make a small hole in the barometer so mercury drips out at a
constant rate. Place the barometer so that it is dripping off the
roof onto the ground. Measure the time between a drop being
released from the barometer and the drop hitting the ground. Repeat
the measurement when moving towards the ground at a known
velocity. The time between a drop being released and a drop hitting
the ground will change. Using the Lorentz transformation equations
and taking the top of the tower as x = 0, the position of the ground
can be found. This will yield the height of the tower.

76: Find a steel cable. Attach it to the barometer and use the
barometer as a physical pendulum to measure g. Then attach the
building to the cable (after having remove it from its foundations
and attaching the cable to a crane of some sort), and using the
building as a physical pendulum, and knowing g, measure its
moment of inertia. This will give the dimensions of the building and
so on.

77: Use a barometer containing sulfuric acid. Break the barometer
on the roof of the building and time how long it takes the acid to eat
its way down to the ground.

78: Measure the volume of the barometer at the bottom and top of
the building. By knowing the coefficient of thermal expansion of
glass, the temperature difference between the top and bottom can
be calculated. Refer this to known data of atmospheric temperature
as a function of height.

79: Every time somebody walks into or out of the building, stab them
with the sharpened end of the barometer (after having sharpened it,
of course). Word of the 'Barometer Murderer' will eventually reach
the building's owner, who will of course be forced to sell the building.
The real estate advertisement should give the height of the building.

80: Knowing the density, width and length of the building, rip the
building from its foundations and place it on top of the barometer,
giving it a pressure equal to the building's weight divided by the
measurement area of the barometer. Thus the weight, and so the
height, of the building can be found.

81: Find the architect who designed the building, crack the
(mercury) barometer over his coffee, watch him die when he drinks
it, then steal the building's specifications, including height.

82: THIS ALSO REQUIRES MORE THAN ONE BAROMETER:
knowing Young's Modulus for brick, place barometers on the roof
until the roof is lowered by one barometer length. This change in the
height of the building under a known stress and Young's Modulus will
give the height of the building.

83: Place a cat on top of the building. Prod it with the barometer so
that it falls off the roof. See whether the cat dies when it hits the
ground. Repeat n times, where n>>{a large number}. Refer to Dr
Karl Kruszelnicki's paper on the probability of a cat dying when
falling from a certain height.

84: AGAIN, MORE THAN ONE BAROMETER: place as many
barometers in the building as will fit. This gives the volume, thus the
height, if other dimensions are known.

85: Use a machine (such as the aforementioned baseball pitching
machine or rail gun) that can hurl the barometer down from the
ground into a hole in the ground at a velocity that is only known to
within a certain tolerance. Find the smallest uncertainty in velocity,
and thus momentum, such that the barometer appears on top of the
building. Use Heisenburg's position-momentum uncertainty
relationship to find the height of the building.

86: Tie a string to the barometer and hang it as a plumb bob. The
string will be slightly deflected from the vertical by the gravitational
effect of the building. This gives the mass of the building, etc.

87: Find at what velocity you must move upwards or downwards past
the building such that the building is contracted to the same length
as the barometer. Find gamma for this velocity, multiply by the
length of the barometer.

Put yourself in suspended annimation until the compound-interest on your
money makes you the richest man on earth, then use this money to capitalize

Master of the Entire Universe, order one of your lackeys to report back you
with the height of that building.  Or you could have the stupid thing
knocked down if you wanted to ...

95: Get some electronic parts, and a block of plasticine, stick the parts,
and some coiled wires into the plasticine, and mount the barometer to this.
Put a sticker on the plasticine, that has, "C4", or "SEMTEX", written in
clear, signal yellow lettering.
  Go to your local airport and highjack an aircraft, explaining that you
will detonate this device unless the pilot does exactly as told, (you can
embroider this performance any way you wish ...  eg.  Wear a towel on your
head and see if you can start a Middle-Eastern war.  Or maybe you could
have some more selfish demands like $50 000 000 in small unmarked bills, or
maybe demand that Roseanne Barr, be forced to give up acting, you know -
whatever you like).
  Anyway, where was I?  So you instruct the pilot to fly directly past the
building at roof level, and as you pass it, simply look at the altimeter.
Ask the pilot if there are any calibration ajustments and then work out the
building height.
  After this you can tell everybody the truth about the barometer and the
bomb, and you can have a jolly good laugh about it and maybe get together
afterwards for a social drink, or something.

Diversify your product by producing a full line of models, the economy
barometer, the standard barometer and the super-duper-extra-deluxe
barometer with vernier caliper and laser scope for high precision
measurements.
Initiate a telemarketing program that calls people late at night asking
them to buy barometers.
Bribe all the physics professors at the university to ask thier students
this stupid question on their exams.  When the stock goes up for sale make
a million dollars profit.  Hire a lobbyist.  Bribe the governor to put
questions about barometers on high school regents exams.  Then create a
contest to see who can find the height of a building using a barometer.
The winner gets a million bucks.  Of course no one really wins, but you get
the answer for free.  Or you could conduct a market survey to measure the
demand for barometers, and use this to measure the approximate height
subject to market fluctuations.

98: Physicist
Get some poor forlorn overworked repressed suffering graduate student to
solve this problem for you.
If he gets the wrong answer threaten to fire him.  Of course you already
know the answer.
This was just for fun.
Then ask your undergraduates the question on an exam.  Somehow none of them

99: Engineer
It is perfectly obvious.  Measure the height of the barometer.  Get a
surveying telescope.  Form a triangle such that the top of the building and
the top of the barometer line up as seen in the telescope.  Then measure

104: Dry method
a) buy a lot of dry sand (e.g. the whole Southern Lybia, oil wells excluded)
b) use the barometer as a shovel
c) cover the building with a perfect cone of sand, avoiding windy days
d) measure the area covered by the sand, obtaining diameter of the cone base
e) knowing the natural slope of the sand you can easily obtain the height
of the building

105: Wet method (requires a lot of barometers of many types)
a) use the barometer as a shovel
b) dig a big hole (bigger than the bulding)
c) use a barometer (better the type mounted on a wood tablet) as a trowel
and cover hole walls with concrete until you have a waterproof basin
d) buy as many water barometers as you can
e) remove water from water barometers and put it into the basin
f) seal all doors and windows of the building with duct tape
g) carefully put the building into the basin
h) measure the volume of water moved by the building

106: Amazon (not the bookshop!) method
a) remove the glass pipe from a barometer and open both ends
b) tie a light rope to the tail of an arrow
c) put the arrow into the glass pipe
d) go on the top of building
e) blow the arrow into the nearest tree
f) measure the rope
g) solve the triangle formed by the rope and the building

106b) Another Amazon method - don't require rope but a stopwatch
a) remove the glass pipe from a barometer and open both ends
b) put an arrow into the glass pipe
c) hit a pedestrian
d) start the stopwatch
e) stop the stopwatch when you hear the howl
f) multiply time x sound speed
This must be repeated many times because reaction time of subjects may vary.
In any case the last method has the advantage that you can verify your
results in a easy way: if a M-16 bullet shooted by the police has x energy
when launched, and y energy when it hit you, you can (well, ballistic
experts can) know the distance between the gun and the hole in your head,
thus measures can be compared.

107: Internet method
a) ask everybody on the Net to submit you a solution
b) print every message (remember to number the pages!)
c) put the pile of paper aside the building until you reach the top
d) use the barometer as paperweight
e) multiply the number of pages for the thickness of the paper

circuit between two parallel non-mercury-wettable conductors at a known
potential difference. Measure speed & direction of motion of droplet due
to JxB forces. Rotate setup about a vertical axis until maximum speed is
found. This gives the direction & magnitude of the vertical component of
the local geomagnetic field.

Repeat at top of building.

Compare differences to know characteristics of the geomagnetic field.

109 :Well, if one drilled a small hole in a the bottom of the barometer,
one could establish the rate at which the mercury drips out of the
barometer.  Then one could attach a small electric motor to the top of the
building.  It could raise the barometer at a known rate.  Using the amount
of missing mercury, one could calculate the time it took to raise the
barometer to the roof.  Ergo, the height of the building is now known_

110. Drink the mercury. If there's an afterlife, ask God how tall the
building was. If there isn't an afterlife, who cares that you don't know
the height of the building?

111. Set the barometer in the middle of the building. Don't look at it as
its wave function expands. When its wave function encompasses the entire
building, solve Schroedinger's equations.

112. Find a flammable barometer. Burn it and measure the time it takes for
the smoke to reach the top of the building.

113. Give it to an MIT student and tell him to transform it into a robotic
barometer specially designed to measure the height of buildings.

114. Tie the barometer to a string. Swing it in front of the architect of
the building while muttering, "You are getting very sleepy. When I snap my
fingers, you will tell me the height of the building."

115. Find a spot on the ground with a known value for hardness. From the
top of the building, throw the barometer down to this spot. (You could also
throw from the ground, but you would have to throw harder.) Repeat until
the barometer bounces up to the top of the building. Measure the force of
your throw and calculate the height of the building.

116. Find a barometer the size of the building. Measure the barometer.

117. Weld barometers to the top of the building until they reach the
moon. The building is approximately a quarter of a million miles tall.

118. Take the current air pressure and divide by zero. Your barometer (and
your test paper) will burst into flames to prevent a violation of
mathematical law. As the professor finds another copy of the test to give
you, sneak into his desk and find the answer key.

119. Heisenberg's Principle of Aesthetics: Measure the color of the
building so precisely that you cannot measure its size. With that done, any
guess is as good as the real answer.

120. Set the building on the barometer. Knowing the density, length, and
width of the building as well as Young's Modulus for the barometer,
calculate the height.

121. Take the volume of the building and divide by its width and
length. When you're done, hold the barometer in the air to signal to the
professor that you are finished with your test.

122. Create your own system of measurement. The unit of length will be the
"building." The building in question is precisely one building tall. When
asked what the barometer was used for, state that it was around for moral
support.

123. Hold the barometer between the index finger and thumb on your left
hand. Hop twice on each foot before breaking out into disco. This is the
rain dance for a certain Native American tribe. When the rain falls, choose
a drop and measure its velocity at the top of the building and its velocity
when it reaches the bottom of the building. Subtract the former value from
the latter, then apply this into the gravity/acceleration formula.

124. Set a tape measure at the bottom of the building. Tie a rope to one
end, string it (the rope) up around a pulley on the top of the building. At
the other end of the rope, affix the barometer as a counterweight. Let it
loose as the weight of the barometer pulls the tape measure to the top of
the building. Go to the bottom and read the tape measure.

125. Set a laser at the top of the building. Fire the laser to the ground
and have it reflect off the barometer. Then, suddenly rotate the barometer
such that the laser is firing at the building. When the building vaporizes,
its height should be zero. You may wish to set the laser on the ground,
though, so you can use it again when you measure the next building.

126. Briskly rub the barometer with a silk handkerchief. Hammer an iron
spike into the ground at the base of the building. Hold the barometer
directly over the spike for one minute, recording any electric
sparks. Repeat many times, and then use the probability of an electric arc
to calculate the distance between the barometer and the grounding wire,
which is also the height of the building.

127. (Works only for underwater buildings). Find a barometer that uses a
liquid lighter than water. Hold it at the base of the building and let
go. Time it as it floats past the top of the building. Calculate the
height.

128. (Only works for buildings in environments with negligible air and
gravity, i.e. space). Move the barometer at a steady speed along the height
of the building while timing it. As every good student knows, d=rt.

129. Use the barometer to measure the density of a pool of liquid. Weigh
the building and drop it into the liquid. Time the building as it sinks
into the liquid. Calculate the height.

130. Hit the barometer onto a piece of flint. Start a small fire. When the
fire alarms ring, the building is evacuated. Extinguish the fire, pull out
a tape measure, and measure the building without anybody standing around to
see that you didn't really use the barometer.

131. Give the barometer to your younger sibling, who will run outside to
play with it. Now that you have peace and quiet, do some internet research
to find the height of the building.

132. (Omega must be greater than one and the cosmological constant must be
less than one for this next suggestion to work) Allow the barometer to come
into contact with an anti-barometer. The explosion should rip the building
off its foundation and send it into deep space. Wait until the gravity of
the universe causes it to collapse on itself. Since the cosmological
constant is less than one, the universe should curl in on itself. When the
universe's diameter is small enough for the building's top and bottom to
meet, measure the universe's diameter and multiply by pi, assuming that the
space-time continuum is perfectly spherical.

Gather 100 friends.  Have each of them guess at the height of the building
100 times.  This gives a sample size of 10000.  Calculate your sample mean
Xn and sample variance s^2.  Since the sample size is large, s^2
approximates the true variance.  Use Xn -Z(s^2)/100 < height < Xn +
Z(s^2)/100 to construct a 1-alpha probability interval for the height of
the building.

Alternatively, have your 100 friends guess at the height n times.
Calculate the sample mean each time. As n goes to infinity, the various
sample means follow a normal distribution with mu = true height of
building.
 
Either way, use the beat your 100 friends over the head with the barometer

A rather advanced solution would be attaching a medium powered transmitter
within the barometer. Now measure the received power in a dipole antenna
with a micro-voltmeter, when the barometer is on the top of building.

Now take the barometer to ground level and then measure the received
power. The difference in receiving power will indicate the loss due to
attenuation which is proportional to height of the building.

This solution works in zero gravity conditions, and
assuming that the barometer and the building have
equal weight.
First perform pirouette like action as a  ballet
dancer without holding anything for 10 sec. and note
the number of rotations. Next try it while holding a
barometer with outstreched arms, note the rotations in
10 sec. Finally hold the building and perform the same
thing.
The moment of inertia depends on the radius. I think
this much clue is enough, you can solve the rest!

An astronomer is on an expedition to Darkest Africa to observe a total
eclipse of the sun, which will only be observable there, when he's captured
by cannibals. The eclipse is due the next day around noon. To gain his
freedom he plans to pose as a god and threaten to extinguish the sun if
he's not released, but the timing has to be just right. So, in the few
words of the cannibals' primative tongue that he knows, he asks his guard
what time they plan to kill him.

The guard's answer is, "Tradition has it that captives are to be killed
when the sun reaches the highest point in the sky on the day after their
capture so that they may be cooked and ready to be served for the evening
meal".

"Great", the astronomer replies.

The guard continues, though, "But because everyone's so excited about it,
in your case we're going to wait until after the eclipse."

                    THE PHYSICISTS' BILL OF RIGHTS

(Author Unknown) We hold these postulates to be intuitively obvious,
that all physicists are born equal, to a first approximation, and are
endowed by their creator with certain discrete privileges, among them a
mean rest life, n degrees of freedom, and the following rights which are
invariant under all linear transformations:

1. To approximate all problems to ideal cases.

2. To use order of magnitude calculations whenever deemed necessary
(i.e. whenever one can get away with it).

3. To use the rigorous method of "squinting" for solving problems more
complex than the addition of positive real integers.

4. To dismiss all functions which diverge as "nasty" and "unphysical."

5. To invoke the uncertainty principle when confronted by confused
mathematicians, chemists, engineers, psychologists, dramatists, and
other lower scientists.

6. When pressed by non-physicists for an explanation of (4) to mumble in
a sneering tone of voice something about physically naive
mathematicians.

7. To equate two sides of an equation which are dimensionally
inconsistent, with a suitable comment to the effect of, "Well, we are
interested in the order of magnitude anyway."

8. To the extensive use of "bastard notations" where conventional
mathematics will not work.

9. To invent fictitious forces to delude the general public.

10. To justify shaky reasoning on the basis that it gives the right
answer.

11. To cleverly choose convenient initial conditions, using the
principle of general triviality.

12. To use plausible arguments in place of proofs, and thenceforth refer
to these arguments as proofs.

13. To take on faith any principle which seems right but cannot be
proved.

If Richard Feynman applied for a job at Microsoft

Interviewer: "Now comes the part of the interview where we ask a
  question to test your creative thinking ability.  Don't think too
  hard about it, just apply everyday common sense, and describe your
  reasoning process."

 "Here's the question: Why are manhole covers round?"

Feynman: "They're not. Some manhole covers are square.  It's true that
  there are SOME round ones, but I've seen square ones, and rectangular
  ones."

Interviewer: "But just considering the round ones, why are they round?"

Feynman: "If we are just considering the round ones, then they are round
  by definition.  That statement is a tautology."

Interviewer: "I mean, why are there round ones at all?"  "Is there some
  particular value to having round ones?"

Feynman: "Yes.  Round covers are used when the hole they are covering up
  is also round.  It's simplest to cover a round hole with a round cover."

Interviewer: "Can you think of a property of round covers that gives them
  an advantage over square ones?"

Feynman: "We have to look at what is under the cover to answer that
  question.  The hole below the cover is round because a cylinder is the
  strongest shape against the compression of the earth around it.  Also,
  the term "manhole" implies a passage big enough for a man, and a human
  being climbing down a ladder is roughly circular in cross-section.  So a
  cylindrical pipe is the natural shape for manholes.  The covers are simply
  the shape needed to cover up a cylinder."

Interviewer: "Do you believe there is a safety issue?  I mean, couldn't
  square covers fall into the hole and hurt someone?"

Feynman: "Not likely.  Square covers are sometimes used on prefabricated
  vaults where the access passage is also square.  The cover is larger than
  the passage, and sits on a ledge that supports it along the entire
  perimeter. The covers are usually made of solid metal and are very heavy.
  Let's assume a two-foot square opening and a ledge width of 1-1/2 inches.
  In order to get it to fall in, you would have to lift one side of the cover,
  then rotate it 30 degrees so that the cover would clear the ledge, and then
  tilt the cover up nearly 45 degrees from horizontal before the center of
  gravity would shift enough for it to fall in.  Yes, it's possible, but very
  unlikely.  The people authorized to open manhole covers could easily be
  trained to do it safely.  Applying common engineering sense, the shape of a
  manhole cover is entirely determined by the shape of the opening it is
  intended to cover."

Interviewer (troubled): "Excuse me a moment; I have to discuss something
  with my management team."  (Leaves room.)

(Interviewer returns after 10 minutes)

Interviewer: We are going to recommend you for immediate hiring into the
  marketing department."

About 15 years ago, several of us sat up our dobs in a shallow canyon

pointed towards the north to avoid the sun shining down the tubes--this
also had them pointing towards the base.

The week-end warriors were flying their exercises, and about mid-day, a
jet roared up the canyon.  Apparently he spotted the scopes and thought
they looked suspicious, because about 30 minutes later two helicopters
came and hovered low over us, looking us over carefully.  After a few
minutes of inspection, they flew off....but returned that evening, well
after dark and lit us up, ruining our night vision.  Since they didn't
fire on us, I guess we passed inspection!

More years ago than I care to think about, back in the early days of
on-line activity, there was a group of us that discussed astronomy on the
old, old version of Prodigy (I still see some of their names here once in a
while).  In those days, every posting was read by a censor prior to
allowing it on-line......we had some real arguments over rejected postings
because the censor that covered the "Outdoor Hobbies" area, where astronomy
was covered, was _!!REALLY!! dumb!  She wouldn't allow any posting
regarding Uranus (she once told me that she KNEW there was no planet with
that obscene name), rejected any discussing about Saturn (no commercials
were allowed, and our efforts to discuss Saturn were "thinly veiled
attempts to promote automobile sales"), and when we tried to refer to
Saturn as the "ringed" planet, she rejected those postings also as
'inappropriate".  She suggested that it would be "more appropriate" to talk
about 'rings' on the jewelry making board.

I raised so much objection to her stupidity with Prodigy management, who
backed her completely, that I (and several others) ended up getting kicked
off of Prodigy!

ASTRONOMY LOSES "MAJOR SCIENCE" STATUS, SAYS WORLD SCIENCE FEDERATION

[**** For immediate release]

GENEVA (AP) January 25, 1999  --  In a surprising announcement, the
World Science Federation said today that the field of astronomy will
no longer be recognized as a major science along with the likes of
physics and chemistry.  Instead it is being reclassified as a
"trans-earth auxiliary scientific pursuit" according to a new taxonomy
laid down by the WSF, the international scientific community's
governing body.

"This is a painful issue that we've been grappling with for some
time," said Dr. Jean-Sven Johansson, president of the WSF.  "The study
of the heavens has been considered a science since prehistoric times.
But if it were just discovered today, with all we've learned in the
intervening millennia, there's no way we would categorize astronomy as
a major science.  It is too soft, too based on speculative theories,
and too far removed from the everyday world."

"[The reclassification] is a difficult but ultimately correct
decision," read a supporting statement from the United States Council
of Scientists.  "While we are sympathetic for practitioners of
astronomy, we believe that the sanctity of science demands a more
rigorous test for inclusion than merely a few centuries of tradition."

The news is a bitter pill for astronomers to swallow.  For years they
have endured derision from their colleagues in the so-called 'hard'
sciences of physics, chemistry, and mathematics.  Only recently had
astronomers believed they'd earned a measure of overdue respect from
the broader community of scholars.  Stunning discoveries from the
Hubble Space Telescope, plus new theories on the origins of the
universe, had put astronomy into the forefront of public
consciousness.

The WSF's announcement changes all that.  While astronomy will still
be studied in schools and research institutions, its practitioners may
no longer refer to themselves "scientists".  No future Ph.D. degrees
may be conveyed by accredited universities of science.  However, a
grandfather clause allows current doctoral students to complete their
studies and earn degrees within 18 months.

Perhaps the most significant changes are in matters of protocol when
scientists meet.  Astronomers will still be permitted to attend
academic gatherings, but they must defer to official scientists in
lectures, workshops, and buffet lines.  They must also refrain from
displaying items that identify themselves as scientists, such as
t-shirts or vanity license plates.

Reaction to the WSF's announcement among astronomers was a mixture of
disappointment and outrage.

"I am very saddened by this decision," said Dr. Velikov Vonk, noted
planetologist and author of the seminal paper 'On Renaming The Big
Bang To Something More Dignified.'  "Astronomers have added much to
the rich history of science and to our understanding of the universe
around us.  I pray the WSF will reconsider."

"It is disheartening, but not altogether unexpected," added Arpad
Arkabaranan, a researcher at the University of New Jersey.  "Rumors
have been circulating throughout the scientific community for several
months.  Personally, I find it the pedantic act of a self-important
panel.  It accomplishes little more than fostering confusion among
schoolchildren and requiring countless textbooks and encyclopedias to
be rewritten, all for the sake of purity of nomenclature.  Does the
WSF not have any more important issues to worry about?"

Other astronomers accepted the news with less equanimity.

"Who died and left them boss?" fumed William McGilly, a propulsion
engineer with NASA's Goddard Research Center.  "I wonder what science
is next on their hit list.  If I were an anthropologist or a geologist
or a cosmetologist, I'd be putting together my resume quickly."

Dr. Johansson points out that astronomy has not been kicked out of the
scientific club entirely.  Rather, it will become "auxiliary
scientific pursuit #1", the first in a new category of demi-sciences
under the WSF's revised hierarchy.  "We will rename astronomy as
'trans-earth studies' to reflect its new status," says Johansson.  "We
believe that after the disappointment fades, astronomers will be proud
and excited to act as the trailblazers in this exciting new arena."

Still, the WSF's announcement could not have come at a worse time to a
field that was felt it was close to turning the corner.  Notable
breakthroughs in coming years would have included the Mars Lander, the
International Space Station, and the much-anticipated results of a
joint Canadian and Japanese task force to develop a pronunciation of
Uranus that would not make high school students giggle.  ("That was
going to be huge for us," says Vonk forlornly.)

The new classification takes effect on April 1st, giving astronomers
precious little time to solve what might be their last problem as
scientists.  For years, English-speaking children have been taught the
phrase 'My very earnest mother just served us nine pickles' to
remember the names of the nine planets in order.  ('My' stands for
Mercury, 'very' for Venus, etc.)  If astronomers downgrade Pluto to a
minor solar object as planned, possibly as their final act before
losing their own official status, a new mnemonic will be necessary.
The solution has eluded astronomers and linguists from around the
globe.

Ponders Arkabaranan:  "My very earnest mother just served
us....nutmeg?  Nachos?  New England Clam Chowder?  Oh, poop!  Give us
time, we'll think of something."

Can anyone tell me if these two guys, Brothers Lance and Theodore, are
around these days?  The messages below date from about three years ago but
have lost nothing over the intervening time!

Begin Quote:

To Brother Theodore,

If thou wouldst but recount thine own experience with refractive glass,
'twould be of exceeding benefit to all--for knowledge increaseth
understanding. For thine edification, Brother Lance would relate to thee an
most perplexing recent incident:

'twas on Solstice eve, when peaceful slumber was interrupted by unexpected
appearance of three Spirits, in close temporal succession, into sleeping
chamber. Spirit of Solstice past did remind Brother Lance of the simple
pleasures afforded him by the three inch reflector of his youth. Spirit of
Solstice present did shew to unto this humble Brother the seeds of
discontent present in wandering eye of he that doth covet the seductive
convenience of Schmidt-Cassegrain and Maksutov, or the "perfect image" of
the refractor (an image obtainable, in truth, only through the unobstructed
reflector).

The final Spirit did prophesy of the great wickedness and depravity that
followeth close upon such covetousness: an evil progression of foul
catadioptric, APO (rotten to the core), CCD, Nagler, cyphering machine in
conjunction with stepping motor (but one step short of perdition), digital
navigator, and all manner of vile optical and mechanical corruption, such
that Brother Lance did fall to his face and clutch at the feet of this
Spirit, to forsake and foreswear all association with such optical
abomination and mechanical Manicheanism.

Next moment 'twas morning, and Brother Lance did find himself deliriously
clutching at the foot of his Brother Dobson type telescope, and oft
repeating the words "I'm not the amateur I was." Mayhap such delirium
resulteth from consumption, on previous even, of many bottles of Brother
Molson's Exceedingly Fortified Special Solstice-Celebration Hop
Beverage--but thou never knowest.

Leastwise, said Spirit hath renewed mine old conviction of the divine
ordination of the reflecting glass, and mine erstwhile held belief in the
absolute depravity of any optical instrument whose design doth deviate from
the simplicity that dwelleth within our beloved Newtonian.

Nevertheless, whether thine eyes are bathed in the pure Light of the
Reflected Truth, or are temporarily confounded by inferior glasses, the
Solstice doth signal the end of darkness, and the beginning of a slow but
steady progression into Light.

May ye all see the Light.

Brother Lance
____


To all:

WARNING: Brother Lance is a member of a strange medieval brotherhood that
zealously defends its choice of telescope: the Newtonian. He speaks at
great length about the evils of refractors, Maksutovs, Naglers, Baker-Nunn
cameras, CCDs, equatorial mounts, and any aspect of astronomy that goes
beyond observing the sky through a simple reflector and a simple
eyepiece. He's been known to bend the truth in defense of his
doctrine. Today's target: the Schmidt-Cassegrain.

Forsooth! Hither stands a one whose learning and illumination are most
evident. The heavens rejoice at your return from the wickedness of the
compound instrument and the refracting glass. Peace unto you, brother.

Much instruction is gained through contemplation of the twofold heresy born
of the unholy union between The Followers of Schmidt and The Order of
Casse-grain. The fallen nature of this depraved cult is made manifest in
the foul instrument through which these children of darkness attempt an
understanding of the world that night doth reveal to those attuned to the
mysteries thereof. The depth of their depravity is revealed in the devious
means by which these scorpions attempt to cover up the optical wickedness
and poisonous aberrations concealed within their evil cylinder. How the
tube doth gleam in vainglorious attempt to please and distract the eye from
the optical corruption hidden within. Yet, to the unwavering eye, how
evident the iniquities of design and grievous inadequacies of
manufacture--grave impediment to the important verities shewed by the
Divine Radiance.

And what host of wretched contrivances these creatures spawn, to facilitate
the capture of Light, both sensible and insensible, upon sensitive plates
(another heresy worthy of much comment). Their ingenious devices, which
serve only to distract from the Observed Truth, are abominations: engines
to counteract the natural and pleasing motion of the sphere of fixed stars;
tiny mirrors in hollow tubes, with which they capture and imprison the off
axis light of a lone star--not to more readily study the Truth contained
therein--but only to guide the aforementioned engine, to restrain or
advance its movement, whilst they pursue their false images.

None of the holy treasures of the sky are safe from the perverse endeavours
of these iconolators. Nay, not even the countenances of the Planetary Gods
are sacred to these lost souls, intent on holding the Divine Light in their
hands, or on their phos-phorescent screens.

BLASPHEMERS!

Sailors of the celestial seas consult charts, and rely upon age old
traditions and intimate knowledge of heaven's shoals to wend their way among
the luminaries. Not so the followers of Schmidt and Cassegrain. This nest of
vipers hath concealed, deep within the bowels of their accursed double fork,
ciphering machines of exceeding complexity, allied with their devilish
enginery, allowing them to navigate midnight's ocean while yet remaining
themselves rudderless.

What manner of evil is contained within those forks? Verily, the pitchfork
of The Enemy containeth fewer of the persuasive powers of perdition.

Consider the injustice suffered by one who steadfastly leadeth a life of
righteousness but, nonetheless, is turned away from Paradise at the last
moment. Is not the situation similar in the case of the catadioptric
abomination? Blessed Light, messenger of Truth, flieth through the aether on
course straight and narrow, without regard for millennium upon millennium in
her path. Mere inches short of her goal, she encountereth the refracting
element, the passage through which rendereth the Light pregnant with false
colour and foul aberrations.

Her chastity is further sullied by the Evil One, whose gross form doth
obstruct one third of the harbour toward which Lady Light is drawn. Dazed,
she proceedeth on to the blessed reflecting element, whereupon she is not
further confounded, but is greeted with warm, momentary embrace--her
remaining purity preserved. Forthwith, she is sent back along her original
path, and suffereth not one, but two more changes of course before the final
necessary travail through the smaller refracting glasses. Brave Lady Light
might endure three reflections and yet maintain her integrity; but in
encounter with refracting element and looming bulk of the Evil One, none
Light can prevail.

I exhort the misguided multitude under the influence of the gravely mistaken
catadioptric teachings to forsake their heresies, and abjure their
compounding of errors. Partake of the glory that the reflecting glass doth
reveal in friendly star, and subtle aspect of Wand'ring Fire, born high on
gentle evening's bowl. And if on that even, by God's grace, the ocean of air
be not troubled, but remaineth still throughout its depth, what marvels and
glad tidings await those who stand with the Brothers of the Reflected
Truth--in awe of the overarching magnificence we behold--eyes fixed upon the
unblemished Light that proceedeth from our simple cylinders. We are content
in the knowledge that brother Newton hath provided the means by which all
Truth may be known. A scope within the grasp of even the lowest of men: a
mirror in whose reflection we might gaze upon the face of Truth: a glass
sufficient to reveal the luminous splendours and divers wonders that
comprise the radiant complexion of the night.

"Most assuredly, the Schmidt-Cassegrain doth suck!

                      FUN FIRSTS DURING MOON PROGRAM
  Besides the dramatic firsts scored leading up to the moon landing - the
successful docking, two weeks in space, first men to go beyond Earth
orbit, etc - there are a number of other firsts that may not be getting
the attention they deserve.
  Of course, Apollo VIII first discovered (or made it so) that the moon
was made not of green cheese, but American cheese.
  But I have a vague recollection that during one of the Gemini space
walks, they scored the first dirty (on the outside) window in space - the
guy (White?) doing the space walk was using some gizmo that fired jets of
gas, and it was causing something to be deposited in the window.  The guy
inside the capsule said something like, "You're messing up my windshield,
you dirty dog!"
  Also, I think it was one of the Gemini missions that scored the first
corned-beef sandwich in space.  One of the astronauts (Grissom?), sick and
tired of the usual "space food", decided to bring some REAL food on a
mission, and smuggled a sandwich on board.  There were crumbs floating
around in the capsule, and it smelled pretty strong, but nothing really
bad happened.
  Anyone have more details on these, or other "fun" firsts on the road to
the Moon?

EXPLANATION OF A SUN ECLIPSE GIVEN AT A BARRACKS

CAPTAIN TO SERGEANT:
Tomorrow there will be a sun eclipse, so I have resolved that the company
will be at the drill field in campaign uniform, where I will give
explanations about the phenomenon, which does not happens every day. If it
rains, though, the company will remain in quarters.

SERGEANT TO CORPORAL:
By orders of our captain, there will be a sun eclipse tomorrow in campaign
uniform. The whole company must be present at the drill field, where our
captain will give explanations about the phenomenon inside the quarters,
which doesn't happen every day if it rains.

CORPORAL TO PRIVATES:
Tomorrow, there'll be a sun eclipse, which will give the necessary
explanations about our captain. The phenomenon will go out in campaign
uniform to the drill field, except if it rains in the quarters, which
doesn't happen every day.

PRIVATE TO RECRUIT:
We'll go out tomorrow to a campaign in a sun eclipse that our captain's
phenomenon fixed up to rain uniforms in the drill field. If it rains,
though, the company will give explanations in quarters, which doesn't happen
every day.

RECRUIT TO FAMILY:
Tomorrow will rain a sun eclipse in quarters, which our captain gave the
company so the drill phenomenon will go to the uniform campaign. If it rains
in the uniforms, which doesn't happen every day, we'll have to take the
eclipse inside quarters.

                 Required Scientific Behavior At Eclipses

Here are a few tips intended to make your eclipse experience extremely
memorable.  REMEMBER !!!:

-  Focus your camera before taking photos.

-  Take a flash photo (full face view) of  someone acting as
"astronomer"  being very serious about trying to take a classic eclipse
photo.  Do
it  just as everybody shrieks "There's the corona!! Oh, its so
BEAUTIFUL!!"
  -  Run around trying to wake up any roosting birds.  Claim they are
  missing a great experience.

-  Wave a bright flashlight around. Hold it eye high and sweep it
horizontally.  Try to see if it's dark enough to see flashes from bike
reflectors, car taillights, etc. That will be fun (anyway, more than
the science part of an eclipse).  Of course, you will undoubtedly catch
many people directly in the face.  That's their problem.  IF anybody
challenges you, tell  them you're doing research for Kodak on the Red Eye
phenomenon and you need a crowd.

-  Buy  a live rooster and take it with you to a popular observing
site, binding its feet to keep it close by.  Put it up high like on a wall
(or on someone else's telescope).  Call to it incessantly (Here Karl
Friedrich Gauss Leghorn, LOOK LOOK!  Pretty soon you'll be getting sleepy.
ACHTUNG !!  YOU DUMB CHICKEN!!   OH GOOD CHICKEN GOOD CHICKEN.  BAD CHICKEN.
THAT's IT! )  Soon, you'll draw a crowd, all eager to watch how the
rooster behaves during the eclipse.
1.  As above, wait until it gets very dark, then take lots of flash
photos of the rooster.  (How else WOULD you get a good photo in the
dark anyhow ??)
2.  Set up movie lights to better see the rooster (String a couple
of long extension cords).  Of course, no one else will be able to see
for 100's of meters, but so what?  And also of course the rooster will not
notice the eclipse.  Scream at the rooster to go to sleep. It won't
help, but will get you lots more attention.  After it's all over, give a
press interview stating your name as someone else (DO NOT USE MY NAME!!!!!).
Claim that this was an individually bad chicken.  Next eclipse you'll
be back with an entire crate of them -- that will give you better
statistics.
Alternatively you can claim you have disproven hundreds of years of
hearsay evidence about eclipse phenomenology -- and you now know that
roosters don't notice eclipses!!!  Make sure they spell (whomever's)
name right.
-  Gape at the dark sky and scream.  "There's Mercury, there's Venus,
there's Mars, there's Pluto. God, there's a new comet!!!  No! I saw it
first." Keep acting like someone else is arguing with you about who
saw it first.  Threaten them loudly that you'll call the police.
-  Talk in a very loud voice.  Claim that all your previous eclipses
were MUCH better because you were always on a cruise ship and those people
were  so much nicer than these German tourist riffraff.  Tell them all how
you hate being there but there were no cruise ships except on the Rhine,
and you HATE the Rhine!!!  Keep this up for the entire eclipse. Pay
someone else to agree with you, that they have had the SAME experience.

                     Better than Neiman-Marcus Cookies

A few years ago I was touring the Jet Propulsion Lab and they showed me
a prototype of the Hubble Space Telescope.  "Pretty cool machine,
guys," I said, "but is there anyway us amateur astronomers can get in
on this kind of action?"  They said yes, plans for the HST were
available through the gift shop.  "How much?"  I asked.  They said
"Fifty."  I said "Great!  Here's my American Express Plutonium Card!"

I picked up the plans and went home, happy as a clam, until I got my
American Express bill.  The total amount due was $50,119.00!  I figured
the $119 must have been from one of these Northwest student ticket
vouchers, but where was that $50,000 from?  Only then did I realize
that JPL had charged me, no fifty dollars, but fifty THOUSAND dollars.
Boy was I mad.  But it was too late to return the plans and get my
fifty thousand dollars back, so I just chalked it up to experience.  But
now I'm getting my revenge...  I asked the folks at the JPL copyright
office if I could give the plans out to all my friends and they said,
"Heck, why not?  What do we need with royalties?  Tell the world!"  So
I've written up the key steps here.  Please post them to every bboard
you can think of and mail them to all your friends.  Remember, if you
break the chain you'll get seven years of bad sunspot interference.

You will need:
1 launch vehicle.
126 "Master Constructor" Erector Sets(tm).
1 Radio Shack(tm) Pro-2001 scanner.
1 2-meter block of glass.
1 box of aluminum foil.
4 sheets of #20 (coarse) sandpaper.
4 sheets of #150 (fine) sandpaper.
2 children's magnifying glasses.


(optional) filters and instrumentation as needed.

Instructions:

  1.  Using the erector sets, construct a superstructure capable of
      supporting a 2-meter mirror and whatever instrumentation you will
      be using.  Make sure that the superstructure can survive the
      G-forces during launch.  Don't be tempted to skimp on the nuts
      and bolts here.

  2.  Using the #20 sandpaper, grind the block of glass until it takes
      on the shape of a convex mirror.  Be very careful in this step
      because if you get the shape wrong you'll have to start over
      again.  Use the #150 sandpaper to smooth out any irregularities
      and fix any minor problems with the focus.  Then melt the
      aluminum foil and vacuum deposit 1-2 atomic layers of aluminum on
      the surface of the mirror.  Mount the mirror in its place in the
      superstructure.

  3.  Mount the children's magnifying glasses at the focal point of the
      mirror.  These will serve as an eyepiece for your instruments.

  4.  Open the back of the Pro-2001 scanner.  There will be a 16-pin
      chip on the upper left of the circuit board labelled 1Y1169AV.
      Carefully clip out the fourth pin on the left and remove it from
      the chip.  This will convert your Pro-2001 scanner into the
      usually much more expensive Pro-2010 scanner with orbital
      transceiver capabilities.  Close the back of the scanner, check
      that the batteries are in place, mount it in the superstructure,
      and connect it to your instruments.

  5.  Make one last check of everything and you're ready to launch!

This is a true story, every bit of it, I swear on my father's sister's
grave.  Even if it isn't, I hope that you get as much use and enjoyment
out of your home-built Hubble Space Telescope as I have from mine!

Warning - only for those with a poor sense of humour like myself....

The Anarchist Astronomer
by J.P. O'Neil

	IN an effort to stop my waistline from reaching 40 before I
do,  a list of
not recommenced" foods has been made up for me by my dear wife, sister
and mother.   You know you are doomed when the three most important
women in your life gang up on you.   Be that as it may, I also suffer
from certain food allergies, and thus there is another list of "foods
to avoid" I must now watch.  Cross reference these lists with foods
that clog arteries or cause cancer or some other fatal malady and the
only edible item left to me is cold oatmeal - provided the water used
to cook it is free of E. Coli.
	Much modern like dietary wisdom, amateur astronomy is beset by
rule that, in my opinion, take much of the fun out of the hobby.    We
are all becoming much too serious and looking sight of the fun that
can be had.  For those who feel burnt out, I present my ten step
program in reclaiming the fun in astronomy.  Now I must admit this
point of view originates from a person who's sole claim to 15 seconds
of fame is hosting an imaginary star party every couple of years, so
take my advice with the proverbial rock of salt.
	
1) Replace Seti with Cindy Crawford

	Every time  a group of armature astronomers gather in a group
larger than three, guess what happens?  Bragging rights over who has
finished the most Seti At Home work units.   The way I see it, you
have a bigger chance of winning the lott0 6/49 than discovering life
out there.  Even if by some wild stroke of luck, you are the one to
discover the real "ET", odds are the only thing that will happen is
guys in dark suits form some secret government agency will raid your
house, confiscate all your computers and shoot you up with weird
psycotropic drugs thus destroying all short term memory.
	So give it a break for a week or a month, go explore the
Bikini of the Day web site until you get your feet back on the ground.

2) Make Sure It's Too Big

	About 15 years ago while observing  a couple of us stuck a
32mm plossl in a 5.5", F3.6 Comet Catcher.  The result was an exit
pupil of almost 9mm.  According to every published article on the
subject, this exit pupil was too large and wasting light.   We also
stuck with it all night as we discover oversized exit pupils are very
comfortable on the eye.    In other words, to my sexist tastes, women
look nicer in high heels, but flat soles are much more comfortable.
So are oversized exit pupils.  Try it and see for yourself.

3)  Observe Only On Fresh Sod

	Think about this.  We all know the sky gods punish purchasers
of new telescopes with rain and layers of new sod with clear skies, so
if you place a new telescope on fresh sod you'll confuse the hell out
of them.  In the ruckus that follows, a couple of clear nights should
slip through.

4)  Play Mind Games With Refractors

	The more expensive refractor you have, the better this works.
When setting up at a star party, aim you refractor at a suitable
planet, pop in one of those 0.965" SR 4mm eyepiece and invite other
amateurs to have a peek.  Act if all is perfectly normal.  If somebody
asks for a better eyepiece, use a Huygens 8mm.    Offer the use of a
nebular filter then screw in one of those ultra-danergour sun filters.

5)    Gather Ye Both Stick and Stones

	Are you at a star party that is just totally clouded out for
the night?   If so, invite everyone to the main tent or main building
for popcorn and a movie.   Then play "The Blair Witch Project".
After everyone goes to sleep quietly place stick figures and small
piles of stones around all the telescopes in the campground.

6)  Swap Table Fun

	This will not make you  make any money, but assuming you can
keep a straight face,  have a hidden camera setup to to capture the
expression on the faces of people as they see these items you have
made up for sale:
	- an optics cleaning kit consiting of 6 grades of steel wool
and a tin of rubbing compound;
	- "Make your own pitch kit" consiting of pine tree seeds and
instructions on how to gather pitch off the tree when it is 20 years
old;
	- a home made split ring mount for a small newtonian that uses
a toilet seat as the split ring;
	- a set of plastic lenses out of a large screen projection TV
labeled "world's most awsome plossl";
	- a half dozen shaving mirrors labeled "20th of a wave or
better!";
	

7) Expand your Horzions Grasshopper

	Tape as many episodes of the "Iron Chef" as you possibly can,
then label all the tapes "Japanese Optical Crafting Techniques" and
donate them to your local astronomy club library.

8) Fight Light Pollution With Madness

	Have all the members of your local astornomy club join the
Druids.  Elect a  high priest, and register with the goverment as a
bonafide charity and/or religion.  Next step is to build a henge,
either surrounding your club observatory or surrounding an urban
observatory.
	Finally, when all in in place, sue city hall for not
respecting your religious rights.  Go to all the medi and scream like
a banshee how light pollution, installed and paid for by the city,
prevents you form observing the stars from your Henge (aka Church) and
thus prevents your religous rites of worshipping the stars.   The more
new age psybabble you can mix into your press releases, the higher
your public appeal will be.

A true incident that occurred on Monday, the 14th of February. In my class
we were celebrating Galileo's birthday. The previous Friday I had given an
hour long lecture on computing angular distances using star charts of the
Mercator style.

After the class sang Happy Birthday in Italian I asked the following:
"All right, who here can tell me the distance from Betelgeuse to Procyon
using your standard chart?"

A hand shot up immediately and my chest swelled with pride. They had
gotten it, I thought.

"About an inch and a half," came the response.

From: Dan McKenna
Do Astronomers Smoke?
Several observatories have a no smoking policy in and around
the telescope and instrumentation as the smoke will coat the optics.
On the other hand,

You no doubt have scene the pictures of Hubbell at various telescopes with
his pipe.

I have watched people smoke at coude focus at two
observatories. One time an observer plugged his heated "flight over all's"
in to the 110 v when it was a 24v heater. The astro started
screaming I am on fire!.. the telescope operator hit the e stop
button which killed the power and wrote in the log book
astronomer smoking at prime focus.
A famous one is the French discovery of a potassium flare
star. It turned out that they where lighting matches in front of the
spectrograph while guiding in order to smoke. We ordered some
french matches and reproduced the spectra as American
matches didn't have the same spectra.
Finally one observer at a 1 meter prime focus telescope that was
in a tube, dropped his pipe down on the mirror cover.
He lowered the telescope and sent his kid down the tube to
recover the pipe and when the kid passed the balance point
the telescope swung to zenith trapping the kid in side.
the day crew had to winch the scope to the horizon so the
kid could crawl out.

The Onion, 10/4/68 "Hippies, NASA Race for Moon."

    The space race between NASA and the hippies is more heated than ever,
with both of the astronautic super-powers vying to be the first to land a
man on the moon. "NASA will win the race to the moon, and the world will
see a United States astronaut, not a longhair, walk on the moon before the
turn of the decade," Apollo 10 Mission Director Gus Lance said Thursday.
    Despite NASA's confidence, hippie-space-program sources report that the
moon will be within their reach in mere months. "Freakonauts have already
outdistanced NASA in their high rate of success with manned missions
throughout the Tibetan Book of the Dead and cosmic voyages Beyond Total
Awareness," said Freedog Osmosis, head of the prestigious Haight-Ashbury
Center for Astraldynamic Research. "And current missions are flying higher
than ever. Take me, for example. I'm sitting right in front of you. Yet,
even as we speak, I'm orbiting at tremendous altitudes." "We are 12 to 16
weeks away from having all the vibes in place to launch, orbit and land a
hippie on the moon," Osmosis said, "as well as to return him safely to a big
oversized floor pillow after wear-off and subsequent crashpad re-entry
burn."
    With the Lunar Excursion Module proven flightworthy in recent Apollo
test missions, it is only a matter of time, NASA scientists argue, before
they win the race to the moon. However, hippies say, a NASA victory in the
space race is by no means certain. "From such early victories as the Byrds'
historic eight-mile-high test flight above San Francisco Bay to recent
trips by The Rolling Stones as far as 60,000 light-years from home, it's
clear that our radical, substance-based approach to space travel boasts
significant advantages over NASA's more conservative methods," said
spacecadet hippychick Raven Transcendence. Trancendence added that the
hippie space program also enjoys a clear economic advantage over NASA:
While the cost of a NASA lunar mission is estimated at $600 million, the
hippie space program, she said, can reach the moon with just a dime bag.
    Hippie space exploration, however, has not been without its
setbacks. In June, shortly after setting his controls for the hear of the
sun, Floyd Commander Syd Barrett lost control of his 50-milligram capsule
and veered wildly off course. According to hippie scientists, he is
currently lost somewhere near Neptune. The scientists project that the
Floyd program will not match NASA's Apollo 8 orbit of the dark side of the
moon untill the mid-1970s. "Yes, hippie space travel does have its
problems," Osmosis said.  "The severe crash-and-burns that follow intense
spaceflight can be devastating, and launch windows are dependent on the
week-to-week booking schedule at the Fillmore West. Nonetheless, we have
repeatedly reached the Sea of Inner Peace and Sea of Undulating Joy-Vibes,
and we're confident that a flower child will touch down on the Sea of
Tranquility soon, certainly no later than the big Woodstock festival next
summer."

Remember: Galileo was an astronomer, and they threw his #$! in the clink.
Exersize caution.

Theres one star easy to find, you will have to wait for daytime though.

Next time you go stargazing, bring a girl along. Set up in a field far from
the city lights and take turns looking through the telescope.Then when the
right moment comes, kiss her, Kiss her!  Dont let the opportunity pass you
buy-it may never come again! Kiss her!

A theologian and an astronomer were talking together one day. The
astronomer said that after reading widely in the field of religion, he had
concluded that all religion could be summed up in a single phrase.

"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you," he said, with a bit of
smugness, knowing that his field is so much more complex.

     Why Hamlet is bad for astronomy

To go, or not to go: that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The barbs and flames of outrageous threads,
Or to take arms against a sea of threads,
And by cross-posting end them? To lie: to lurk;
No more; and by a killfile to say we end
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
newsnet is heir to, 'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. To lie, to lurk;
To lurk: perchance to learn: ay, there's the rub;
For in that lurk of death what threads may come
When we have shuffled off this portal web,
Must give us pause: there's the download
That makes calamity of so long winter;
For who would bear the whips and scorns of saa,
The observers wrong, the luddite's contumely,
The pangs of despised goto, the light's delay,
The insolence of Shawn and the Vols
The patient merit of the unworthy pukes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With an LX200? who would tripods bear,
To grunt and sweat under a telrad,
But that the dread of something after dawn,
The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
No stargazer returns, puzzles the will
And makes us rather bear those scopes we have
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus the mafia does make cowards of us all;
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of a bad coating,
And telescopes of great aperture and mount
With this regard, tube currents turn awry,
And lose their resolution.--Soft you now!
The fair Ophiuchus! Nymph, in thy horizons
Be all your stars remember'd.

 A young astronomer came rushing into the office of the head astronomer and
announced:
  "Sir!  I have just spent the last 6hrs at our telescope and have made an
astonishing discovery!  However, there is good news, and bad news!"
 The old astronomer, naturally, asks: "What is the good news?"
  "I have just discovered a new galaxy, that has just appeared, and is only
14 light years away from our own!", replied the young astronomer.
  "My God, that's fantastic, that's wonderful, amazing, etc. What bad news
could there possibly be about that?"  The old astronomer quieried.
  The young astronomer replies, "Sir, it's BLUE!"

             THE SEX LIFE OF AN ELECTRON (with unhappy ending)

One night when his charge was at full capacity, Micro Farad decided to
get a cute little coil to discharge him.  He picked up Millie Amp and
took her for a ride on his megacycle.  They rode across the wheat stone
bridge, around the sine wave, and into the magnetic field next to the
flowing current.

Micro Farad, attracted by Millie's characteristic curve, soon had her
field fully excited.  He laid her on the ground potential, raised her
frequency, lowered her resistance, and pulled out his high voltage
probe.  He inserted it in parallel and began to short circuit her shunt.
Fully excited, Millie cried out, "ohm, ohm, give me mho".  With his tube
at maximum output and her coil vibrating from the current flow, her
shunt soon reached maximum heat.  The excessive current had shorted her
shunt, and Micro's capacity was rapidly discharged, and every electron
was drained off.  They fluxed all night, tried various connections and
hookings until his bar magnet had lost all of its strength, and he could
no longer generate enough voltage to sustain his collapsing field.  With
his battery fully discharged, Micro was unable to excite his tickler, so
they ended up reversing polarity and blowing each other's fuses.

One night when his charge was pretty high, Micro Farad went to see
if he could find a cute little coil to let him discharge.
He picked up Milli Amp, and took her for a ride on his Megacycle.
They rode accross the wheatstone bridge, along the sine wave and
stopped at a magnetic field flowing with current.
Micro Farad soon had her resistance at a minimum level. They laid
against ground level. Micro Farad then inserted his probe in Milli
Amps socket. Mho, Mho, give me Mho, she said.
They fluxed all night, trying out various connections.
Afterwards Milli Amp tried self-induction and damaged her probe.
After this, they went home and oscillated happily ever after.

And the Lord said, "Let there be light," and there was light. He/she/it
saw that it was . . . bent . . . and verily backed he/she/it away therefrom
to ponder. Upon seeing that this anamoly would bring forth much confusion
and concern among his/her/its creations he/she/it summoned forth one of the
angels who lurked there about and gave him/her/it instruction.

"Goeth ye down to the earth and the inhabitants thereof with this sacred
law that I shall giveth thee and there thou shalt deliver it unto one who
shall be named Snell and thou shalt instruct him to diseminate this law
hither and yon to all the lowly students of Physics 101 so they may go
forth into the world and enlighten the inhabitants thereof regarding this
apparent error in my divine creation. Thou shalt admonish the one called
Snell that he is to make it clear that the law worketh in both directions,
yea going in and coming out, and that it is universal to all things that
possesseth a property I shall call optically clear wherein I have limited
the speed of light to less than that of the heavens. He shall call the
ratio between these two speeds the Holy Index of Refraction and he shall
writeth it down as I have given it to you, using the humble small letter n
and he shall separate the n of the heavens from the n of the materials
possessing the properties I have outlined by calling them n1 and n2. The
Holy Convention shall dictate that n1 is to the left and n2 to the right so
that all shall proceed with their calculations in the same manner. Thus it
shall be for all time, yea, even relativistic."

Thus the angel went down to the earth and did as he/she/it had been
instructed by the Lord and it came to pass that Snell, being a faithful and
obedient servant of the Lord, did precisely as he had been instructed. The
Lord saw that this was good and named he/she/it the results of the law
refraction and the people of the earth accepted his/her/its law in all its
various forms, yea, even the simpleminded thin lens formula, and rejoiced
in the name of the Lord and the word refraction was on the lips of every
student who had the great privelege of graduating from high school.

When light passes from one medium to another, it obeys a set of partial
differential equations (which "optimize" the path as it were). The light
"slows down" for the amount of time it takes for it to solve the
equations. But if the light is experienced enough, it can solve the
equations faster than when it first started out.

Truly retarded light has so much trouble solving the equations
that it just gives up and bounces back into the original medium
(roughly four percent?)...

Although we modern persons tend to take our electric lights, radios,
mixers, etc. for granted, hundreds of years ago people did not have any of
these things, which is just as well because there was no place to plug them
in. Then along came the first Electrical Pioneer, Benjamin Franklin, who
flew a kite in a lightning storm and received a serious electrical shock.
This proved that lightning was powered by the same force as carpets, but it
also damaged Franklin's brain so severely that he started speaking only in
incomprehensible maxims, such as, "A penny saved is a penny earned."
Eventually he had to be given a job running the post office.

After Franklin came a herd of Electrical Pioneers whose names have become
part of our electrical terminology: Myron Volt, Mary Louise Amp, James
Watt, Bob Transformer, etc. These pioneers conducted many important
electrical experiments. Among them, Galvani discovered (this is the truth)
that when he attached two different kinds of metal to the leg of a frog, an
electrical current developed and the frog's leg kicked, even though it was
no longer attached to the frog, which was dead anyway. Galvani's discovery
led to enormous advances in the field of amphibian medicine. Today, skilled
veterinary surgeons can take a frog that has been seriously injured or
killed, implant pieces of metal in its muscles, and watch it hop back into
the pond -- almost.

But the greatest Electrical Pioneer of them all was Thomas Edison, who was
a brilliant inventor despite the fact that he had little formal education
and lived in New Jersey. Edison's first major invention in 1877 was the
phonograph, which could soon be found in thousand of American homes, where
it basically sat until 1923, when the record was invented. But Edison's
greatest achievement came in 1879 when he invented the electric
company. Edison's design was a brilliant adaptation of the simple
electrical circuit: the electric company sends electricity through a wire
to a customer, then immediately gets the electricity back through another
wire, then (this is the brilliant part) sends it right back to the customer
again.

This means that an electric company can sell a customer the same batch of
electricity thousands of times a day and never get caught, since very few
customers take the time to examine their electricity closely. In fact, the
last year any new electricity was generated was 1937.  Today, thanks to men
like Edison and Franklin, and frogs like Galvani's, we receive almost
unlimited benefits from electricity.  For example, in the past decade
scientists have developed the laser, an electronic appliance so powerful
that it can vaporize a bulldozer 2000 yards away, yet so precise that
doctors can use it to perform delicate operations to the human eyeball,
provided they remember to change the power setting from "Bulldozer" to
"Eyeball."

                    My, But That's An Attractive Lawn Mower

Scientists aren't the only ones capable of starting relationships in the
lab. Often times, in our effort to get that last result, we forget about
the feelings of the equipment which we so callously use and discard.  This
is one such story of the love between a lawn mower and an NMR-MRI imager.
Machines, yes, but machines wich couldn't bear to be separated.

The research facility had just received their new NMR-MRI System and had
been careful to inform the cleaning staff of the hazards of working around
such a piece of equipment ... the high magnetic field wreaking havoc with
any metal bearing equipment, erasing banking cards and terminating
electrical equipment.  This also includes pacemakers although you gotta
wonder how they determined that the machinery would affect pacemakers,
experiments or just a good guess.

They were even so careful as to put the magnet well towards the back wall,
away from the general working area of the facility.  Yes, they were careful
in telling the caretaking staff.  Unfortunately, no one had taken the same
care in informing the outdoor, groundskeeping staff.

Shortly after the system was set up, one of the outdoor maintenance crew
was mowing the lawn near the back wall of the facility.  Picture the
idyllic setting as the groundskeeper in wandering around the yard on a
bright summer's day.  The sun is shining, the birds are singing and the
blades of grass are flying around in the normal manner when cut by the
mower.  Suddenly, the mower is yanked out of the groundskeeper's hands and
is flung against the wall, suspended three feet off the ground with no
signs of support.  The surprised fellow spent quite a while trying to pry
the mower of the wall but to no avail.  It doesn't take a scientist to tell
you that this only happens on Roadrunner cartoons.  What was the poor man
going to tell his boss?

Eventually, when everyone became aware of the problem, they got their heads
together and tried to come up with a reasonable expanation for this sudden,
non-Newtonian event.  Unfortunately, someone was running an experiment at
the time and noticed the change in the field.  Following the commotion,
they discovered the problem and, using a tow truck (not a piece of
equipment which is usually issued with an MRI but we won't quibble), they
were able to pry the mower from the wall.

This wall is now surrounded at a distance by a large fence and no one cares
if the grass grows long and unruly.

batteries.

4. Attach the hamster to a hand-crank generator and then drop it onto a
trampoline.

generator.

13. Put hamster on electricity-generating treadmill. Feed back small
portion of generated electricity into hamster brain pleasure center. Watch
him generate his little heart out!

14. Seal large quantity of hamsters in air tight holding tanks. Add
water. Allow suitable time to pass for decomposition. Collect methane gas
resulting. Put gas in fuel cells.

15. Smush mucho hamsters in a trough, use the drippings/blood to run a
waterwheel for hydroelectric power.

16. Give hamsters lots of shitty beer. Use piss and vomit to run
hydroelectric generator.

17. Skin hamster. Melt animal fat into tallow and then form candles. Heat
steam turbine.

18. Switch hamsters for P6 chips coming of Intel assembly lines. Saved
electricity will be enormous. Cover performance loss by releasing new
version of Windows NT at the same time. -gwh

19. Build glass room. Put hamsters inside. Put cocaine inside. Ground the
floor and attach negative leads to the ceiling. -gwh

20. Have hamster steal one of Kube's magic cards. Leech power from
resulting nuclear strike.

21. Teach hamsters to play blackjack. Once they're at the competitive
level, convince Las Vegas hotel owners to convert to serving
hamsters. Saved electricity from smaller lights, hotels, etc. -gwh

22. Accumulate enough hamsters that the self-gravitational force causes the
mass to shrink and heat up. Use thermocouples to generate energy. -gwh

23. Raid PG&E corporate headquarters. Threaten to drop hamster down CEO's
pants unless he gives you a power plant. -gwh

24. Get several dozen hamsters. Shoot them up with crystal meth. Attach dog
sled.

25. (This is, undoubtedly, the way to get the most power from them) Combine
the hamster with an equal mass of antimatter -- a anti-hamster if you
will. Then harness the massive energy release for power....

26. Have the Emperor warp and twist a hamster clone into an evil
Anti-Hamster, Darth Hamster. This should be good for 4-6 sequels. Install
tension to electricity converters into theatre. -gwh

27. a. Find a _good_ genetic engineer. b. Splice appropriate genes from
electric eels into hamsters, because they're smaller and cuter and, well,
hamsters. c.  Feed the hamsters. d. Surgically install appropriate
electrodes. e. Periodically drain off the voltage.  Unfortunately, this
only gets you DC current. P.S. How could I have been so blind? Splice in
genes from blue-green algae as well, and you wouldn't even have to feed the
hamsters! (Well, maybe some phosphorous and iron and stuff)

28. Mail the electric company a dead hamster every day until they give you
power for free.

29. Crossbreed hamster with a Mothra (a giant rodant in India) and use
resulting giant mutant lightning-breathing hamster as power source.

30. Give the hamster to Scotty, he'll find some way to yeild 20% more power
from the dilithium crystals.

31. Take thousands of hamsters into orbit -- when the orbit decays, they
will heat up the atmosphere. With enough hamsters, you could raise the
planets temperature as much as you want.

32. Pull the hamster out of root@soda's ass. Then when they turn red &
embarrassed, use the heat from their red face to drive a Carnot engine.

33. Emmass enormous quantities of hamsters until it reaches enough mass to
begin hamster fusion in the core.  Use solar cells to convert radiation to
electricity. - seano

34. Throw in more hamsters to 33 (above) until the hamster star goes
supernova... you couldn't want any more energy than that...

35. Repeat 34 with another mass of hamsters... spin the resulting
neutron-hamsters around each other in a binary orbit... use gravity waves
to rotate hydro-turbine.

36. Take five or six hits of acid. Tell yourself very firmly that hamsters
_are_ electricity. (Well, they've got lots of electrons in them, yes?)
Acquire hamsters however you choose; "operationally", you've now got
electricity. (I say "five or six hits", because I find that things which
were perfectly clear to me after _one_ hit, e.g., that the word "Krups" is
actually a make onomatopoeic piece of German slang for an unprintable
Viennese practice, make absolutely no sense afterwards; and Leary used to
take five hits or so. QED.)

37. Give them little magnetic collars, and run them through a maze of
coiled wires.

38. Reduce hamster to their component atoms. Compress the resulting plasma
until it fuses. Transfer the released energy via heat/engine or energy
conversion scheme of your choice. -ERic

39. Take two hamsters, run one through a klein bottle to convert it to
anti-matter. Combine the first hamster with the anti-hamster. Harness the
resultant massive burst of energy as per #38 above. -ERic

40. Drop hamster into black hole. Use photovoltaics to release the radiated
energy. -Eric

41. It is a well-known result of quantum field theory that all fields are
symmetric under the combined action of time-reversal, charge-conjugation
and parity-inversion operators: the familiar TCP symmetry. It is trivial to
show that time reversal and charge conjugation both take fermions into
their anti-particles. Use this to show that plucking hamsters from mirrors
will produce beaucoup electromagnetic radiation. (Hint: Do you need to pull
the hamsters out of the mirror _going_backwards_in_time_?)  Ref:
J. J. Sakurai, _Adv. Quan. Mech._

42. Put female hamster scent on glass rod. Release male hamster. He will
try to rub his furry coat against glass rod. Drawback: only creates static
electricity.

43. Teach Hamsters how to use a Bloomberg terminal to trade OTC (Over the
counter) Electricity products.  Smarter Hamsters can be trained to risk the
lives of many dumber hamsters in a highly leveraged exotic derivative to
make profit in terms of electricity.
Note: There will be no hedge instruments against the lives of hamsters as
hamsters are plentiful and can be breeded with great ease.

A friend of mine has a theory about things electronic: they operate on
smoke. It is very important for each component to have the correct amount
of smoke, which is sealed inside at the factory. If this smoke ever gets

what the gas smelled like).

Anyway, back to the story.  We had an old bottle of phosgene gas in the

The following is an excerpt from my physics lab book.  Needless
to say, it was a long day in the lab.

Errors in our Calculations:

  ...Clearly, friction played a large role in our >75%<< error
in our calculations, but the force of friction alone cannot
affect much more than 5% of the experimental results.  After
pondering other things that might have also affected the
experiment, I came up with a couple things:

 1) Measurement of pi.  We only used pi to 2 decimal places (3.14157
would have given more accurate results)

 2) The moon's gravitational effect.  We didn't take into effect the
gravitational effect of the moon orbiting the earth.  If it can cause
tides, it can affect our experiment.

 3) The book is wrong.  Who knows?  Newton lived a long time ago,
before the Internet, and before highly sensitive electrical equipment.
Perhaps all the equations we used are outdated and inaccurate.  I will
write a letter to the publisher immediately when I can confirm this.

 4) Gravitational pull caused by us.  My lab partner and I both exert
a very tiny, but significant, gravitational attraction.  This could
have effected the pendulum in many ways, especially since we were
moving around a lot.

 5) Inaccurate measurement of weight.  We never actually weighed the
pendulum.  We just used the value in the book.

 6) Accumulation of dust.  During the course of the experiment, I
noticed dust accumulating on the bob of the pendulum.  Oh, wait,
frequency of a pendulum has nothing to do with mass.  Forget 5 and 6.

Well, seriously, these other potential pitfalls are still very
insignificant, so that leaves me with only one conclusion:

  My lab partner screwed up.

I take no responsibility for these errors, because I put faith in my
lab partner that he would solve the equations accurately.  In the
past, we have experienced problems with his inability to punch numbers
into his calculator in the correct order.  I also noticed him
furtively peeking over on the other lab tables.  Pardon my frankness,
but this guy is not very bright, and I don't know how I got stuck with
him.  I probably should just double check his work, but I'm sure he
would be insulted and create a scene.  I've had problems with him
in the past, and if the sole vindicator of our inaccurate lab data is,
in fact, my lab partner, this would explain the last three labs,
which, as you may recall, had errors similar in scope.

It's common practice in England to ring a telephone by signaling extra
voltage across one side of the two wire circuit and ground (earth in
England). When the subscriber answers the phone, it switches to the two
wire circuit for the conversation. This method allows two parties on the
same line to be signalled without disturbing each other.

Anyway, an elderly lady with several pets called to say that her telephone
failed to ring when her friends called; and that on the few occasions when
it did ring her dog always barked first. The telephone repairman proceeded
to the scene, curious to see this psychic dog.

He climbed a nearby telephone pole, hooked in his test set, and dialed the
subscriber's house. The phone didn't ring. He tried again. The dog barked
loudly, followed by a ringing telephone.

Climbing down from the pole, the telephone repairman found:
1. A dog was tied to the telephone system's ground post via an iron
  chain and collar.
2. The dog was receiving a 90 volt signalling current.
3. After several such jolts, the dog would start barking and
  urinating on the ground.
4. The wet ground now completed the circuit and the phone would ring.

Which shows you that some problems can be fixed by just pissing on
them.

          BUTTERED BREAD ON THE BACK OF A CAT: WHAT FALLS FIRST.

Daniel D. Van Hoy wrote:
>Just think: When you drop a cat from a few feet, it lands upright.

First the source of the forces must be understood. The force acting on the
bread is not the butter, as some may think. Without the bread, butter
wouldn't land bread side up, and therefore the force could not possibly be
in the butter. We know the force is not the bread because it has been
experimentally proven that bread does not land any particular side down
without butter. The bread/butter force is caused by the fusing of bread and
butter particles together. This fusion causes energy to be released in the
form of shifting gravity and anti-gravity energy to opposite sides of the
bread/butter continuum. The gravity energy naturally shifts to the butter
since it is denser then the bread, while the anti-gravity energy shifts to
the bread side.

The energy in a cat for landing on its feet comes from the feet themselves.
This has been proven experimentally. Cats without feet have a near zero
success rate of landing on their feet. We will call this energy cat foot
energy.

Considering the equal but opposing bread/butter and cat foot forces one
would expect the cat to spin violently about its axis. However the strength
of these forces must be considered. A regular cat is not structurally
stable enough to withstand the torque the spinning causes. I should not
have to describe the way the cat's limbs give way, the way the legs wrench
around until the feet are on the same side of the cat as the butter. And
thus the cat can then land on its feet, butter side down.

We are now researching the possibility of using structurally reinforced
cats for levitation systems, but so far the cost is too high to be
practical. Several attempts at producing economically viable systems were
made by separating the feet so that the instability of the cat would not be
a factor. At first there was dificulty because there was no cat to tie the
bread to. Later it was discovered that when not attached to a cat the feet
lost their cat foot force over time. It is hypothesized that the feet need
to be living to exert the cat foot force, and so far no practical method
has been found for keeping the feet alive other than a cat.

Attempts are also being made to breed flat cats with no legs (only feet).

There are many other problems related with this method of levitation as you
may well imagine, but they are beyond the scope of this discussion.

[The following question was originally posed by Steven Wright.]
Question: If you strapped a slice of buttered bread to the back
of a cat, which way down would it land?

[Well, here's an explication of that question...]

I'm glad you asked this question.

IF WHEN YOU DROP A BUTTERED PIECE OF BREAD, IT DROPS BUTTER SIDE DOWN AND A
CAT ALWAYS LANDS ON ITS FEET. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU TOOK A PIECE OF
BUTTERED BREAD, STRAPPED IT ON THE BACK OF A CAT (BUTTER SIDE UP) AND
DROPPED IT OFF CENTERPOINT TOWER?

Even if you are too lazy to do the experiment yourself you should be able
to deduce the obvious result. The laws of butterology demand that the
butter must hit the ground, and the equally strict laws of feline
aerodynamics demand that the cat can not smash it's furry back.

If the combined construct were to land, nature would have no way to resolve
this paradox. Therefore it simply does not fall.

That's right you clever mortal (well, as clever as a mortal can get), you
have discovered the secret of antigravity! A buttered cat will, when
released, quickly move to a height where the forces of cat-twisting and
butter repulsion are in equilibrium.  This equilibrium point can be
modified by scraping off some of the butter, providing lift, or removing
some of the cat's limbs, allowing descent.

Most of the civilized species of the Universe already use this principle to
drive their ships while within a planetary system. The loud humming heard
by most sighters of UFOs is, in fact, the purring of several hundred
tabbies.

The one obvious danger is, of course, if the cats manage to eat the bread
off their backs they will instantly plummet. Of course the cats will land
on their feet, but this usually doesn't do them much good, since right
after they make their graceful landing several tons of red-hot starship and
pissed off aliens crash on top of them.

Q:If you dropped a cat with a piece of buttered toast tied to its back (
butter side up of course) Which way up would it land?

A:This is the secret of levitation. Toast ALWAYS lands butter side down,
but cats always land on their feet, so the combination will hover just
above ground level rotating, neither the cat nor toast able to land.

From: Daniel Marshall <9774327@Narga.Sun.ac.za>
Here is Physical proof from a Physics Student!

Well Acording to Newtons third law, a force acting upon an object will
exert an equal but opposite force on the adjacent object. The cat exerts
a force say C on the toast, which in mathematical notation is Ft = -C =
( Mass of cat )x g.

Acording to Murphys law of probability, any event in a constant time
frame is said to happen to the inverse of the most prefferable. In this
case, we have only two possible cases, P(T = toast) lands buttered side
up or Ti=1-P(T) (Inverse probability of toast) landing downwward.

But From our previous metion of Murphys Law, we can clealy see that P(T)
= 0( or 0% of it happening ) and P(T) = 1 ( or 100% of it happening ).

Thus this is an equilibrium problem as there are two forces acting in
two different directions namely T and C. If The Air resistance is taken
into consideration, and we have that C = T then if the toast is placed
only slightly to the side of the center of gravity of the cat then we
have a non-equilibral condition. So this then implies a rotational
tourqe ( call it t for short ). The t can be calculated by applying the
tangental force aplied multiplied by the cross product of the radius r
of the cat to the toast. So

t = Cos(theta)x r x ( Aplied force )

But this aplied force is quite weak as it's only reliant on air
resistance. But this then presents us with another problem. We have a
conflict of laws of phyics and phylosophy ( ie. Murphy vs Newton )
Ienstein in his thesis on general relativety however sshowed that
Newton's III law does not always aply to Objects nearing the speed of
light. So the only conclution that we can draw is that the cat with the
toast strapped to its back will rotate at near light speeds. However,
the closer one gets to the center of the cat the faster the cat will
have to spin. So the cat will not only spin, but be completely mangled
in the process by the fact that Its insides spin faster that it's skin
and outer flesh!

The law that cat's also land on there feet is also going to play a part
n this disscusion. Whe released, The two forces C and T will
simulaniously act opon one another, causing the cat and the toast to
iether shoot upwards indefenetly increasing in speed as gravity
decreaces the further one is away from earth or hover or plummet
downwards. The latter seems the most feesable, with a difference however
that it will not stop. The immence rotations of the cat and toast will
generate enormous amounts of heat as it comes into contact with the
ground through friction and tunnel downwards eventuall reaching the
center of the earth. By that time the cat's legs wil have been eroded
away and the butter will be off the toast and thus the laws which we
first used do not apply any more. So to cat will stop spinning somewhere
in the earths crust.

I hope that helps!

I DEMAND AN END TO ALL THIS!!!
My seventeen hovering pussies are not amused.
Although I should perhaps tell you that after careful experimentation
regarding the thickness, composition, and density of the thread, I have
determined that the rate of descent of the pussy/toast-unit can be
accurately adjusted. This is particularly useful as a sort of timing
device. Since the combination eventually lands with such commotion (due to
the opposing effects of the toast/pussycat laws), ones attention is
invariably drawn to it. Events such as putting out the garbage, watching
the 6 0'clock news, or cooking eggs spring readily to mind. When the
frustrated, bewildered, agitated, and terrified pussy is finally coaxed out
from under the bed, the device can easily be reset by using the appropriate
thread for the time frame required, and then simply hurling it into the
air. I have also discovered that the rate of descent is also related to the
cost of the carpet. Perhaps Mr. Marshall could calculate the appropriate
formula?

Flaws In the Flying Cat Theory: A Response

Special to the Coastal Beacon

A logical analysis of the BFAD (Buttered Feline Antigravity Drive)
propulsion theory clearly demonstrates the impossibility of such a system.

Let us begin with a simple analysis.

1) Buttered bread must fall butter side down.
2) A cat always lands on its feet.

While both theorems are indisputable, the oracle offers no proof of the
construct. The oracle implies that anyone who 'would' test this construct
would immediately find the secret of BFAD.

This is clearly nonsense.

Let us assume a normal Einsteinian universe (although a Euclidean universe
would serve our purposes just as well, the Einsteinian is both cheaper and
drinks are readily available.)

To test BFAD, one must procure:

Bread
Butter (margarine, for some reason, will not work)
A cat
A strapping device.

Let us assume that all of these are readily available.

Attach the strapping device to the cat.

See?

No cat.

what has happened? We have run up against an a priori universal law. By a
priori, we mean that it takes priority over either the Buttered Bread
Principle or the Law of Feline Landings.

What happens is that the instant a strapping device and a cat occupy the
same four dimensional space, the cat disappears.

Now, this can easily be tested, and has been repeatedly. There are two
schools of thought about this phenomenon.

The first holds that a cat and a strapping device are constituted out of
different fundamental building blocks. According to this theory, a cat is
constituted primarily of superquarks, (called meows by current theorists.)
These superquarks demonstrate qualities that are both atomic (constituted as
they are of groupings of normal quark particles) and feline (because these
quarks exhibit characteristic of "charmed"  or "lucky" particles.) Again,
according to this theory, strapping materials are fashioned out of
non-charmed particles. Bringing the two together causes one or the other to
cancel out. One aspect of this theory that has not been sufficiently
explained to date is the fact that it is always the cat, not the strapping
device, that disappears.

The second school of thought, and it is one that appears to be gaining
ground in academic circles today, holds that cats are, in fact,
super-intelligent pan-dimensional beings who exist in our four dimensional
universe only because there is plenty of good food and a lot of creatures
stupid enough to provide the food, along with plenty of attention. Whenever
a strapping device appears, the cat simply opens a door to a different
series of dimensions, and goes on an extended tour.

According to this theory, purring is a cat's way of maintaining a constant
balance cycling across multiple dimensions. This school holds that
antigravity is impossible, but that theoretically, a REALLY good grip on a
cat, while reaching for a strapping device, could result in our ability to
cross dimensions with ease (barring scratches, that is.) Pessimists argue
That if there was anything really interesting in those other dimensions,
cats wouldn't spend so much time here, so why ask for a good scratching?

In an unusual collaboration, scientists at the Conrell SuperNatural
Computer Facility, the USDA and the Conrell Agricultural College have
made a startling breakthrough in the gravitational physics field.
Using technology modelled on giant computers at Conrell and tested in
the laboratory, the group has succeeded in defying gravity.

Scientist Elsie Browncow explained how the break came about.  "We were
examining possible applications of Murphy's famous laws, and we got to
thinking about buttered bread always falling butter down.  We came to
the conclusion that butter must have some very special properties
related to gravity.  Reports of cows jumping over the moon lent support
to our theory.  Once we were on the right track the rest came easily."

Local dairy farmers, who have been scratching their heads over the
large butter orders from the research facility, are ecstatic over the
discovery.  Evidently, several hundred pounds of butter are required
to overcome gravity in a region of space of 1 cubic centimeter.  Asked
about this Dr. Browncow replied, "... well, yes, that's true, but we're
working on improving the process and are pretty sure we can reduce the
butter requirement significantly."

Rumor has it that the CIA and NASA are trying to limit access to the
process.  Dr. Browncow would not comment on the rumor except to say,
"The word is out now and if we could figure this out I'm sure others
will too - that's how science works."  Local dairy farmers have been
accused of discharging firearms at government vehicles seen near the
labs lately.  No arrests have been made.

I hate to be a kill joy but the sollution is quite easy:

1) When you drop a piece of buttered bread, it lands with the buttered side
down

BS = Down to earth

2) When you drop a cat from a few feet, it lands upright.

Cat feet = Down to earth

If you strapped a piece of buttered bread to the back of a cat, which would
land first.

Law of cat Constraint (Symilar to the law of pill rejection)

 Any attempt to constrain a cat is equal or less than the potential energy
to reach escape velocity. (applies to strapping devises)

Firstly it is unlikely that the cat can be constrained without a
thermonuclear hyrdaulic restraining devise. Should such devise be obtained
another law will take over.

The second law of Cat Composition

 A cat will conform to the standard laws of physics relating to solids
unless such as the opening of food or dairy products occur - in which case
it's ability to stretch twist and mould are equal or better than that of a
liquid.

The sollution is that in the case of a suitable contraining devise being
found the toast will not land prior to the butter being consumed by the

It's simple:
What you have to do is stick the butter on the cat's ass, that way friction
will decrease on the way down, and he'll accelerate to the speed of light
and cut right through the earth, come out through China and into the
atmosphere creating a black hole.

For the questions of What would happen if you tied a piece of buttered
bread to the back of a cat? the answer is this:

First you have to look at the system scheme. The bread and the cat are not
one complete thing. If you looked at a side-veiw of the bread-cat, the
bread would stick out of the cats back. Because of this, the bread could
land first, allowing a tiny split second for the cat to turn and land
second, or vice versa. If you want to create anti-gravity, your going to
have to hollow out a space inside the cat for the bread to go, so that when
one lands, the other lands at the exact moment.

I haven't been able to hollow out a cat, and still have it live long enough
to land on its feet. There is going to have to be some major genetic
engineering.

The outcome of this experiment would seem to be uncertain. This is
reminiscent of the Uncertainty Principle, which would suggest that this is
actually a quantum case. The cat-toast construct can exist in two states:
butter-side down, or feet-side down. Most researchers would have you chose
between the two states, but they ignore the most obvious of solutions: the
cat-toast construct will exist in both states at once! It will
simultaneously be butter-side down and feet-side down. This duality shall
continue until the cat-toast construct is observed by a researcher, at
which time the cat will panic and escape the bonds holding it to the toast.

Conclusion: Clearly, we have made an error in selecting the feline on which
to experiment; we were accidentally using Schroedinger's cat.

Science and love are inseparable. That is the theme of the AIR
Campaign for Textbook Improvement ("AIRCTI -- pronounced "AIR
kitty"). AIRCTI aims to warm the cold, emotionless textbooks of
today by adding to each a love interest.

Investigator Charles N. Horton has synthesized a love interest for
the textbook  "Organic Chemistry," 4th Edition, by John McMurry
(Brooks/Cole Publishing Company, Boston, 1996). Horton mixed in
the romance of a couple named Dan and Melissa. Here are relevant,
abstracted snippets from the revised textbook:

..
CHAPTER 5: AN OVERVIEW OF ORGANIC REACTIONS
   Dan was shopping for some organic bean sprouts when he bumped
into Melissa. "Oh! You like organic stuff too?" he asked. "Yes,"
she said, "and I know this great organic cafe..."
..
CHAPTER 11: REACTIONS OF ALKYL HALIDES: NUCLEOPHILIC SUBSTITUTIONS
AND ELIMINATIONS
   "Oh no," thought Dan. She already has a boyfriend. I must
substitute myself for him! But how?
   And then a light came on in his mind. "I can eliminate him
using an alkyl halide nucleophile!"
..
CHAPTER 30: THE ORGANIC CHEMISTRY OF METABOLIC PATHWAYS
   And so, they lived happily ever after on the pathway of love...

             THE CHEMIST'S RECIPIE FOR CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES

The following recipie for chocolate chip cookies recently appeared in
Chemical & Engineering News (C&EN, Jun 19, 1995, p. 100). It was
attributed to Jeannene Ackerman of Witco Corp.

Ingredients:
 1. 532.35 cm3 gluten
 2. 4.9 cm3 NaHCO3
 3. 4.9 cm3 refined halite
 4. 236.6 cm3 partially hydrogenated tallow triglyceride
 5. 177.45 cm3 crystalline C12H22O11
 6. 177.45 cm3 unrefined C12H22O11
 7. 4.9 cm3 methyl ether of protocatechuic aldehyde
 8. Two calcium carbonate-encapsulated avian albumen-coated protein
 9. 473.2 cm3 theobroma cacao
10. 236.6 cm3 de-encapsulated legume meats (sieve size #10)

To  a  2-L jacketed  round  reactor  vessel  (reactor  #1) with an  overall
heat-transfer coefficient of about 100 Btu/F-ft2-hr add one, two, and three
with constant agitation.

In a second 2-L reactor vessel with a radial flow impeller operating at 100
rpm add four, five, six, and seven until the mixture is homogeneous.

To reactor #2 add eight followed by three equal portions of the homogeneous
mixture in reactor #1. Additionally, add nine and ten slowly with constant
agitation. Care must be taken at this point in the reaction to control any
temperature rise that may be the result of an exothermic reaction.

Using a screw extrude attached to a #4 nodulizer place the mixture
piece-meal on a 316SS sheet (300 x 600 mm). Heat in a 460K oven for a
period of time that is in agreement with Frank & Johnston's first order
rate expression (see JACOS, 21, 55), or until golden brown.

Once the reaction is complete, place the sheet on a 25 deg. C heat-transfer
table allowing the product to come to equilibrium.

Anyway, I think this is a good idea.  Here's my contribution.  These are
"crazy phrases" from some works on several Moscow city and regional
high-school chemistry olympiads (I've been a member of the Organizing
Committee for them for a number of years and I really miss this now).  By
the way, if anybody knows about similar things here in the US (and
Indiana in particular) - I will be gratefull.

Unfortunately, all of these citations are in Russian (obviously ;-) and,
what is much worse, most of them are unexpected (for their authors) puns,
which are impossible (at least for me) to translate (some of these puns
were just great, all the Orginizing Committee was rolling on the floor
in tears ;-).  I found only several phrases allowing translation (not
best pearls, unfortunately...):

[For the question: "Why H2S is a poison for us?"] :
"H2S reacts with the iron in hemoglobin, forming an insoluble FeS, thus
causing the oxygen deficiency"  (there were some variants like Fe2S,
Fe2S3, Fe2S2...  But - isn't it a good idea, especially taking into
account that it was in the work of a 13 years old guy?)

[for the question: "Why lead compounds are poisons for us?"] :
a) "Lead ions make sugar in the blood poisoned"
b) "After Pb2+ gets in the stomach, since there is the Cl- in the stomach
juice, the reaction Pb2+ + 2Cl- ---> PbCl2 (s) occurs, and the unsoluble
PbCl2 precipitates into the stomach, thus distorting food digestion"

"Also the produced hydrogen is a gas with nasty smell"

[At the end of the work] :  "Damn, done!"

"When AgNO3 reacts with NH4Cl, there forms the precipitate kind of white
and Ag salt"  (Everywhere I tried to translate it equivalently to it's
Russian prototype, saving the grammar mistakes and style ;-)

[For the problem "Find mistakes in the following procedure of preparation
of diluted H2SO4: .... "] :
a) For preparation of diluted (strictly - solution) sulfuric acid one
   must not use concentrated H2SO4.
b) There is no such thing as "volumetric flask"
c) The mixture of ice and table salt DOESN'T EXIST!

"Ice and NaCl mixture?  Crap! The ice would momentarily melt because of
NaCl!"

"To the sulfuric acid one must add water, but not water to sulfuric acid"

[The following was on the VERY weak work (it happened that the teacher
said to pupils : "You won't get a good grade unless you go to the
olympiads" and sometimes there was just a bunch of people who were not
interested in chemistry and had came only "to be marked good" in
teacher's eyes).  They were starving there, because they were unable to
solve any problem, they couldn't leave because of a teacher, and they had
to entertain themselves.  But how?  Probably the oldest way to entertain
oneself is to write something nasty to somebody else (also proved by
recent anonymous posting about grad. schools ;-).  Ok, enough theory,
I explained the joke, you may start laughing here :-)   Okh, one more
explanation:  "pud" is an old Russian wieght unit, equals 16 kg:

"Don't have enough sake to find the mass % without calculator.  That is
why:
        It's better eat a "pud" of shit,
        Than solve your chemistry, damn it!"

(this was rhymed!  We thought about making this verse an unofficial
slogan of our Committee ;-)

Will check in my books about any funny chem. experiments.
Regards to all, would like to see other responces.

professor observed what she was about to do, out of the corner of his eye

intending to do, asked her first to stir the water in the bucket for five
minutes before adding the potassium. She was puzzled and ran after him to

                          Whats that concoction?

My high school chemistry teacher, Mr. McKaskill was fond of making these
chemical concoctions and then checking out their properties.  He would make
the weirdest combinations of chemicals with leaves, wood, basically
anything he could get his hands on.  Once the entire building had to be
evacuated because he mixed up sulfur with some acid and something else
which even he cannot remember, producing hydrogen suphide in large
quantities.  Whenever we came to his class in the morning there was some
new combination lying in some beaker somewhere.

Anyway, one day just before class I walked up to his table and picked up a
container of some red gooey liquid.  Mr. McKasill had been working late the
previous day, so I thought that this must be the result of his work, so I
turned to him and said "Mr. McKasill, what is this muck.  It looks like
diarrhea with blood in it" He turns around, looks at me with bleary eyes
and then says in a tired voice "Please leave that Prashant.  Thats my
lunch."

A ubiquitous Fe-rich Male compound - FeMale - posesses a considerable number of
beneficial properties. Frequently highly decorative in the native form, FeMale
is a proven aphrodisiac and a versatile detergent. There are also reasons to
believe that FeMale plays a crucial role in human reproduction and
child-rearing.

Despite the existence of vast archives of experimental data, the reaction
pathways involving FeMale are at best poorly understood.

FeMale is unstable in an oxydizing atmosphere and has been known to
spontaneously ignite at room temperature. As a consequence FeMale is rather
difficult to work with.

The magnetic behaviour points towards polymorphism. It varies from sample to
sample ranging from moderately antiferromagnetic to very strongly
ferromagnetic. Curiously, some antiferromagnetic specimens appear to undergo a
spin transition when exposed to alcohol-rich atmospheres (the well documented
Beer-Goggles effect).

Given the availability of reactive Fe, FeMale forms readily in Male- dominated
environments and under favourable circumstances may persist over geological
time. FeMale may thus prove to be of considerable importance on a global scale
as an Fe- and Male- reservoir.

Every human release carbon dioxide by breathing, so, if 5 billon people
stop breathing, we may go back to the ice age .

Cut trees [at night]
Well, trees transform CO2 into O2 by day, but when night comes, their evil
CO2 producing task, begins.  so, let's cut all trees at night. cut all the
rainforest in a few nights.

Well, the company blamed that on "the wrong kind" of CO2....

There has been a novel advance in the chemistry of propellants.
Investigator Keith G. Tomazi reports:

"I just came across a novel rocket fuel, as reported on Page 1 of
the Wall Street Journal (Tuesday, April 10, 2001):

	The New York City-based Fighters' Institute for Survival and
	Training, or FIST, helps boxers with life outside the ring.
	But the group...hopes to become a union for boxers....
	That pace sounds familar to Paul Johnson, a Minneapolis
	ex-boxer. He has tried to get the Boxer's Organizing
	Committee off the ground for about 12 years....Still,
	he believes that a union is imminent. "We've got the
	rocket ship on the pad, we're pumping liquid nitrogen,
	and we're going to blast off," he says.

"This is one picket line that I wouldn't care to cross. Still,
their chemistry seems unusual: I wonder if anybody else has
proposed a non-flammable rocket fuel?"

                      THE CHEMIST'S SONG

Sung to the tune of Monty Python's "I'm a Lumberjack and I'm Okay."

        CHEMIST                            CHORUS

I'm in chemistry and I'm okay,           He's in chemistry and he's okay,
I sleep al night and I work all day.     He sleeps all night and he works
                                                                 all day.
I clean my flasks, I read my JACS,       He cleans his flasks, he reads
                                                                 his JACS,
I do reactions well.                     He does reactions well.
Someday I'll be unlucky                  Some day we'll all be lucky
And blow my self to Hell.                And watch him blown to Hell.

I'm in chemistry and I'm okay,           He's in chemistry and he's okay,
I prowl the library all day.             He prowls the library all day.
The articles that I could use            The articles that he could use
Are gone when they're in need.           Are gone when they're in need.
If I were a bookbinder,                  If he were a bookbinder,
I'd have them all to read!               He'd have to learn to read.

I'm in chemistry and I'm okay,           He's in chemistry and he's okay,

I go to seminars.                        He sleeps through seminars.
When I do any research                   The Boss can take his research
I just wind up with tars.                And shove it up his arse.

I'm in chemistry and I'm okay,           He's in chemistry and he's okay,

I do my work, I teach a class,           He does his work, he teaches class,
I earn another buck.                     He earns another buck.
There's one girl in my section           There's one girl in his section
I'd surely like to fail.                 He's never gonna fail.

I tell him I'll make progress            He tells him he'll make progress
And work so hard I'll pant.              Although he really can't.

For non cesiophiles, cesium is the most electropositive element known,
and as such has merited its own newsgroup alt.cesium.  It has a number
of unique properties:

  o   It explodes violently on contact with water.

  o   It burns with a brilliant blue flame - the name cesium derives
      from the sky-blue lines in its spectrum.

  o   It's hydroxide (what is left after it is finished exploding with
      water) is the most powerful base known, and will eat through
      glass.

  o   It is used as the central component of cesium-beam clocks, the
      most accurate time pieces in existence.

  o   When consumed over a period of time, it produces a characteristic
      mania.

The following songs were posted to news:alt.cesium over a period of several
weeks.

                            SONGS OF CESIUM
                      Translations from the Cesish


Translator's note:

The ancient manuscripts from which these songs are derived are
fragmentary, and consequently the accuracy of the following
translations must be taken with a grain of Cesium Chloride.  In places,
the translator has filled in gaps to the best of his ability using
available knowledge about the culture and traditions of ancient Cesia
much of which, is itself controversial.  Legitimate questions may
certainly be raised, see for example, the comments on #117.  To aid in
perspective, the songs are presented in the order in which they were
translated, rather than numerical order, as the translator learned much
during the process of translation.  The effort is an ongoing process,
as the collection of available fragments is vast; and new translations
may be added to this catalogue periodically.  For now, Enjoy, Sing, and
Hail Cesium!!!  RN

Oh Cesium
(Tune, Oh Christmas tree)

Oh Cesium, oh Cesium,
Thy spectrum doth us please-ium.
Thy sky-blue lines in plasma's fire,
Do dreams of icy lakes inspire.
Oh Cesium, oh Cesium,
Thy spectrum doth us please-ium.

Oh Cesium, oh Cesium,
When held, you never freeze-ium.
Thy gently smoking silver spheres,
When dropped in water, please the ears.
Oh Cesium, oh Cesium,
When held, you never freeze-ium.

Oh Cesium, oh Cesium,
You put us at our ease-ium.
You tend the seconds of the day,
So that our watches never stray
Oh Cesium, oh Cesium,
You put us at our ease-ium.

I Wish I had a Pound

Oh I wish I had a pound of cesium.
Oh I wish I had a pound of cesium.
I would take it in the shower,
And I'd glory in its power.
Oh I wish I had a pound of cesium.

Cesium

Cesium, 'tis of thee,

Of thee I sing.

Glorious too, for suicide,
Here, death, is thy sting.

Cesium the Beautiful

Oh beautiful for blue of skies,
Among thy spectral lines.
When cast upon the waters clear,
Thy splendid fire shines.
Oh Cesium,
Oh Cesium,
Our days we trust to thee.
Thy faultless rhyme,
In keeping time,
From care doth set us free.

Cesium (Burning in the Dead of Night)
(Tune, Blackbird)

Cesium burning in the dead of night.
Take your sky blue lines and start to shine.
All my life,
I was only waiting for the moment you were mine.

Cesium burning on a lake of ice.
Lift your glorious flame up to the skies.
All your life,
You were only waiting for some water to arise.

Cesium burn.
Cesium burn.
Give your light to this coal black night.

Why Don't We Mix Up the Two

(Tune, "Why don't we get drunk..."
with apologies to Jimmy Buffett)

I've got a pound of Cesium,
It's burning gently near.
The sky-blue flame looks lovely,
But it's noise I want to hear.
So darlin' bring some water,
A couple pints'll do.
And why don't we mix up the two?

Why don't we mix up the two?
'Cause Cesium and water,
Really make a wicked brew.
You say I've got a death wish,
But honey, I'm just blue.
So why don't we mix up the two?

Yesterday

Yesterday.
I had Cesium with which to play
Now all my fingers have been blown away.
By cesium, since yesterday.

Yesterday.
Her sky blue flame appeared to light my way.
Now the world seems so cold and gray.
My eyes are dim since yesterday.

Why she had to blow,
I don't know,
They wouldn't say.
I used water wrong,
And my skin dissolved away.

Yesterday.
Her path seemed such an easy way.
Now I know that there's a price to pay.
Oh, I believed just yesterday.

---Songs of Cesium #117

Soon after the publication of the above translation
A mysterious monkey paid a call and pointedly insisted
that the translation of SOC #117 (Yesterday) from the Cesish was seriously
flawed, particularly in the second stanza, and offered a corrected
version, which I supply without further comment.
RN

Yesterday

Yesterday,
I had Cesium with which to play.
Now all my fingers have been blown away.
And silence reigns since yesterday.

Suddenly,
I'm just half the man I used to be.
I have no eyes with which to see.
My legs have parted company.

Why she had to blow,
I don't know,
I can only say.
Something went awful wrong,
In the waterbed where we lay.

Yesterday,
Her sky blue path seemed such an easy way.
Now I know there is a price to pay.
Oh, I believed just yesterday.

'Lectropositive Mama
(tune, Lady Madonna)

'Letropositive mama,
Cesium on your meat,
Wonder how you manage,
To stay on your feet.

How d'ya stand the smokin'?
How d'ya 'bide the flame?
Do you think that life's just
A burnin' game.

Monday night your hunger's a blue fire,
Tuesday morn' you're cookin' 'fore the sun.
Wednesday rain, you're only flamin' higher,
Having your fun.

'Lectropositive mama,
Cinders in your curls,
No way can compare you,
To ordinary girls.

Likin' the explosions,
Rock you on your seat.
How can any woman handle
All that heat?

It's So Easy
(Tune, It's so Easy)

It's with Cesium I'm in love!
It's with Cesium I'm in love!

People say that I'm a fool,
When I take my Cesium into the pool.
And it's so easy,
So doggone easy,
Yes it's so easy,
Where my love's concerned,
To get myself burned.
But it's with Cesium I'm in love,
It's with Cesium I'm in love!

I look into her flame and see,
A sky-blue light floodin' over me.
Though it's so easy,
So doggone easy,
Yeah it's so easy,
When she's concerned,
To get myself burned.
Still it's with Cesium I'm in love,
It's with Cesium I'm in love!

Cesium (All through the Night)
(Tune, Fever)

(1)
Never know how much I need you,
Never know how much I'd dare,
When I mix you up with water,
I get a heat that's hard to bear.

I need my Cesium!
Burnin' brightly,
Cesium to give me light.
Cesium --
In the morning,
Cesium all through the night.

(2)
Sun lights up the daytime.
Moon lights up the night.
Cesium lights up heaven above,
With a brilliant sky-blue light.

I need my Cesium!
Burnin' hotly.
Cesium shinin' so bright.
Cesium --
In the morning,
Cesium to make me feel right.

(Coda)
Everybody,
Needs some Cesium,
Cesium to give 'em that glow.
Cesium --
Add some water,
Get a fire hot as down below!

(3)
Romeo, he had Cesium,
Cool water Juliette.
When they mixed it up together,
Things got as hot as they can get!

They needed Cesium!
Flamin' madly.
Cesium burnin' so blue.
Cesium --
Shared between them.
Cesium to make their love true.

(4)
Come to the end of my story.
Got to the point that I made.
Cesium's the stuff to heat you up,
And you ain't gonna find no shade!

You'll need cesium!
As you sizzle.
Cesium some comfort to earn.
Cesium --
It's almighty.
What a lovely way to burn!

Cesium Glows
(Tune, Love's a Rose - Neil Young)

Cesium glows, but you better not lick it,
It's fire grows when it's on the tongue.
Lips full of holes, you'll know you've kissed it,
Just take a bite if you want to die young.

I want to see what's never been seen,
I want to dream that Cesium dream.
Come on love, we can glow together,
Let's eat it all right now.
Take a bite right now.

I want to lie in a hole in the ground,
Six feet deep, and twelve feet 'round.
Sky blue light around me shinin',
Pale blue worms upon me dinin'.

Cesium glows, but you better not lick it,
It's fire grows when its on your tongue.
Mouth full of holes if ever you kiss it,
Gimme a spoon 'cause I wanna die Young.

Cesium's Burning
(a round, tune Scotland's Burning)

Cesium's burning, Cesium's burning.
Look out!  Look out!
Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!
Pour on water, pour on water.
Oh shit! Oh shit!

Seventy Six Neutrons
(Tune, Seventy Six Trombones)

Seventy six lithe neutrons swayed on Cesium's bar,
Half a hundred and ten bold protons...

Hold it!  Hold it!. That's Cesium 131. Half life only about 9.69 days.
Let's go for immortality here. Worth a shot anyway...

Seventy Eight Neutrons
(Tune, Seventy Six Trombones)

Seventy eight lithe neutrons swayed on Cesium's bar,
Half a hundred and ten bold protons joined the press.
And the eletronettes were a-whirling in duets,
All but one, the singular miss Six S.

Seventy eight nubile neutrons writhed in close array,
Half a hundred and ten lusty protons swelled the crowd.
And the electron pairs played blue photonic airs,
From within a shining quantum cloud.

There were pions, muons, quarks and other fermions,
Tunneling, tunneling, in a state of partial dress.
'Till an oily bit of water came a wandering,
And miss Six S got in a great big mess.

Seventy eight screaming neutrons ran and jammed the door,
Half a hundered and ten brave protons hit the ground.
There was a sky-blue flash, then nothing left but ash,
And the echo of a glorious thundering sound.

--- Songs of Cesium #76

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cesium's Strange
(Tune, People are strange - The Doors)

Cesium's strange,
when you're a stranger
Consummate danger,
ready to blow.
Water is wicked,
wet and unwanted,
Folks are unfriendly,
when you glow.

Don't take it out in the rain.
You're insane!
You're insane!
Don't you remember the pain?
You're insane!
You're insane!
You're insane ---

Cesium's strange,
pregnant with danger,
Hand the next stranger
a kilo or two.
Pour on the water,
lamb at the slaughter,
Bathe in the light
that is blue, sky-blue!

Don't take it out in the rain.
You're insane!
You're insane!
You'll always remember the pain.
You're insane!
You're insane!
You're insane ---

2.  I'm Dreaming of a White Precipitate

I'm dreaming of a white precipitate
   just like the ones I used to make
Where the colors are vivid
   and the chemist is livid
      to see impurities in the snow.

I'm dreaming of a white precipitate
   with every chemistry test I write
May your equations be balanced and right
   and may all your reactions be bright.


3.  Silent Labs

Silent labs, difficult labs
All with math, all with graphs
Observations of colors and smells
Calculations and graph curves like bells
Memories of tests that have past
   Oh, how long will chemistry last?

Silent labs, difficult labs
All with math, all with graphs
Lots of equations that need balancing
Gas pressure problems that make my head ring
Santa Chlorine's on his way
   Oh, Please Santa bring me an 'A'.

4. Deck the Labs

Deck the labs with rubber tubing
  Fa la la la la, la la la la.
Use your funnel and your filter
  Fa la la la la, la la la la.
Don we now our goggles and aprons
  Fa la la la la, la la la la.
Before we go to our lab stations
  Fa la la la la, la la la la.

Fill the beakers with solutions
  Fa la la la la, la la la la.
Mix solutions for reactions
  Fa la la la la, la la la la.
Watch we now for observations
  Fa la la la la, la la la la.
So we can collect our data
  Fa la la la la, la la la la.

5.  The Twelve Days of Chemistry

On the first day of chemistry
   My teacher gave to me
A candle from Chem Study.

(second day)   two asbestos pads
(third day)    three little beakers

6.  Test Tubes Bubbling
(to the tune of "Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire")

Test tubes bubbling in a water bath
    Strong smells nipping at ypur nose.
Tiny molecules with their atoms all aglow
    Will find it hard to be inert tonight.

They know that Chlorine's on its way
    He's loaded lots of little electrons on his sleigh
And every student's slide rule is on the sly
    To see if the teacher really can multiply.

And so I offer you this simple phrase
    To chemistry students in this room
Although it's been said many times, many ways
    Merry molecules to you.

7.  O Little Melting Particle
(to the tune of "O Little Town Of Bethlehem")

Para Dichloro Benzene
   how do you melt so well?
The plateau of your cooling curve
   is really something swell.
We think the heat of fusion
   of water is so nice
Give up fourteen hundred cals per mole
   and what you get is ice.

8.  We Wish You a Happy Halogen

We wish you a happy halogen
We wish you a happy halogen
We wish you a happy halogen
To react with a metal.

Good acid we bring
   to you and your base.
We wish you a merry molecule
   and a happy halogen.


9.  Chemistry Wonderland

Gases explode, are you listenin'
   In your rest tube, silver glistens
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
   Walking in a chemistry wonderland.

Gone away, is the buoyancy
   Here to stay, is the density
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
   Walking in a chemistry wonderland.

In the beaker we will make lead carbonate
   and decide if what's left is nitrate
My partner asks "Do we measure it in moles or grams?"
   and I'll say, "Does it matter in the end?"

Later on, as we calculate
   the amount, of our nitrate
We'll face unafraid, the precipitates that we made
   walking in a chemistry wonderland.


10.  I Saw Teacher Kissing Santa Chlorine

I saw teacher kissing Santa Chlorine
   under the chemistree last night
They didn't sneak me down the periodic chart
   to take a peek
At all the atoms reacting in their beakers;
   it was neat.

And I saw teacher kissing Santa Chlorine
   under the chemistree so bright
Oh what a reaction there would have been
   if the principal had walked in
With teacher kissing Santa Chlorine last night.


11.  O Come All Ye Gases

O Come all yea gases
   diatomic wonders
O come yea, o come yea
   calls Avogadro.

O come yea in moles
   6 x 10 to the 23rd
O molar mass and molecules
   O volume, pressure and temperature
O molar volume of gases at S.T.P.


12.  We Three Students Of Chemistry Are

We three students of chemistry are
   taking tests that we think are hard
Stoichiometry, volumes and densities
   worrying all the time.

O room of wonder
   room of fright
Room of thermites
   blinding light:
With your energies
   please don't burn us
Help us get our labs all right.


13.  Iron the Red Atom Molecule
(to the tune of "Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer")

There was Cobalt and Argon and Carbon and Fluorine
   Silver and Boron and Neon and Bromine
But do you recall
   the most famous element of all?

Iron the red atom molecule
   had a very shiny orbital
And if you ever saw him
   You'd enjoy his magnetic glow
All of the other molecules
   used to laugh and call him Ferrum
They never let poor Iron
   join in any reaction games.
Then one inert Chemistry eve
   Santa came to say
Iron with your orbital so bright
   won't you catalyze the reaction tonight?
Then how the atoms reacted
   and combined in twos and threes
Iron the red atom molecule
   you'll go down in Chemistry!


14. Lab Reports
(to the tune of "Jingle Bells")

Dashing through the lab
   with a tan page lab report
Taking all those tests
   and laughing at them all
Bells for fire drills ring
   making spirits bright
What fun it is to laugh and sing
   a chemistry song tonight.

Oh, lab report, lab reports,
   reacting all the way
Oh what fun it is to study
   for a chemistry test today, Hey!

Chemistry test, chemistry test
   isn't it a blast
Oh what fun it is to take
   a chemistry test and pass.


15.  Silver Nitrate
(to the tune of "Silver Bells")

Silver nitrate, silver nitrate
   it's chemistry time in the lab
Ding-a-ling, with a copper ring
   soon it will be chemistry day.

Take your nitrate, in solution
   Add your copper with style
In the beaker there's a feeling of reactions
   silver forming, blue solution
Bringing ooh's ah's and wows
   now the data procesing begins.

Get the mass, change to moles
   what is the ratio with copper?
Write an equation, balance it
   we're glad it's Chemistry Day.

        CHEMISTRY CHRISTMAS

'Twas the night before Christmas,
The lab was quite still;
Not a Bunsen was burning
   (Nor had they the will).
The test tubes were placed
   In their racks with great care,
In hopes Father Chemistry
   Soon would be there.

The students were sleeping
   So sound in their dorms,
All dreaming of fluids
   And Crystalline forms.
Lab-Aids in their aprons
   And I in my smock.

When outside the lab
   There arose such a roar
I leaped from my stool
   And fell flat on the floor.
Out ot the fire escape
   All of us flew.
What was the commotion?
   Not one of knew.

The flood-lights shone out
   O're the campus so bright
It looked like old Stockholm
   On Nobel Prize Night.
My fume-blinded eyes
   Then viewed (dare I say?)
Eight anions pulling
   A water-trough sleigh.

And holding the bonds
   Tied to each one of them
Was a figure I knew
   As our own Papa Chem.
With speeds in excess
   Of most X-rays they came.
As they Dopplered along
   He called each one by name.

"Now Nitrite, now Phosphate,
 Now Borate, now Chloride
On Citrate, on Bromate,
   On Sulfite and Oxide.

Forget what you know
   Of that randomness stuff,
Let's go straight to that roof,
   If you've quanta enough."

As fluids Bernoullian
   Behave in a pinch,
Those ions said "Alchemist
   This is a cinch."
So up to the lab-roof
   Those "chargers" they sped
With Pop Chemistry safe
   In his water-trough sled.

Just a microsec later
   Electroscopes showed
Charged particles coming
   To our lab abode
We raced back inside,
   And what d'ya think?
Down the fume-hood Pop Chem fell,
   Right into the sink.

He was dressed in a lab-coat,
   Quite ragged and old,
With removable buttons
  (The style, we're told)
A tray-full of beakers
   He clutched to his heart--
And under his arm
   Was an orbital chart.

His eyes through his goggles
   I just couldn't see
His hands were all yellow
   From H-N-O-3.
His head was quite bald
   With a fringe all around
Like a ring test for iron,
   That same shade of brown.

He puffed a cigar
   With a smell not at all
Unlike the organic lab
   Right down the hall.
The smoke billowed forth
   From his angular face
And with Brownian Movement
   Enveloped the place.

He was thin as a match
   And not terribly tall
He wasn't the type
   I'd expected at all
But a look at his clothes,
   In the lab's harsh white light,
With their acid-burn holes--
   He's a chemist all right!

He didn't say much
   (He had no time to kill)
And filled all the test tubes
   With nary a spill.
Then placing them bak
   On the benches with care
He dashed to the fume-hood
   And rose through the air.

He called to his team
   And his ions took off
And kinetics took care
   Of Pop Chem and his trough,
But I heard him cry out
   As he flew down the street
  "Merry Holidays to all!
   May your stockrooms stay neat!"

Chemists are, on the whole, like physicists, only 'less so'.They don't make
quite the same wonderful mistakes, and much what they do is an art, related
to cooking, instead of a true science. They have their moments, and their
sources of legitimate pride. They don't split atoms, as the physicists do.
They join them together, and a very praiseworthy activity that is.

Before Richard Wagner completed his Ring cycle he wrote the well-known
opera on chemical themes "Tristan und Diels-Alder".

Other composers to write chemical operas include Jacques Offenbach ("Tales
of Woodward and Hoffman"), Richard Strauss ("Electron"), Giuseppe Verdi ("A
Masked Buckyball") and Wolfgang Mozart ("Die Sauerfloete").

Many modern composers have undertaken similar projects, such as Nigel
Osborne ("The Elecrophilic Substitution of the Soviet Union"), Leonard
Bernstein ("Chloride"), John Adams ("Neon In China"), and Philip Glass
("Einsteinium On The Beach"). However, some critics believe Rossini's "The
Silicon Ladder" to have been a more significant influence on Glass. Sir
Michael Tippett was nitred in recognition of his chemical opera "The KNO3
Garden".

Health Watch: The graduate student's guide to self-diagnosis and treatment.

It is not unusual for a grad student to feel strains and stresses in the
body during late night lab marathons.  In spite of this fact, there is an
appalling shortage of health clinics open at the hour that these symptoms
usually begin to manifest.  In recognition of this deficiency, this
`how-to' list has been compiled to aid the graduate student in this time of
need.

During grammar school science experiements into properties of different
alcohols:

The residue of each test was tipped down the sinks, which were grouped in
threes.  There were no U-bends, but each group of sinks emptied into a single
box, which overflowed into the mains sewers.  Presumably this was intended to
retain things like droplets of mercury, which was not banned from use when I
was 16.

During the session, my bunsen went out, so I re-lit it with a splint lit from
the teacher's bunsen.  For safety's sake (!) I dropped the burning splint
into the sink, intending to extinguish it with water, instead of waving it
around in the alcohol fumes.  A small blue flame disappeared down the
plughole.  Hum, thinks I, I wonder where that's going?

I opened the cupboard 'neath the sink, only to find the drain box, full of
alcohol, a roaring mass of flame.  Shutting the doors, I called out, "Er,
Sir..." just as the inch-thick wooden lids blew off the adjacent un-used
sinks.  Fortunately, the back-blast extinguished the flames under the
cupboard, so the box only sagged slightly!

Proof that chemistry and computer programming should never be mixed

When I was in grad school, a classmate and I decided that a very dirty
computer keyboard needed cleaning.  We figured that water would be
dangerous to the electical circuitry, so we elected to clean the
keyboard with acetone.

We were right; the electrical circuitry survived just fine.  However,

The keyboard never had to be cleaned again.

I've had my fair share of lab disasters, most of them fairly
unimpressive. The one I am about to describe though was quality. I swear to
God, this is a true story.
 
We had a monday afternoon double hour and a half practical. On this
particular occasion we were oxidizing ethanol to ethanoic acid. If I
remember rightly you reflux it for twenty minutes with dilute HCl to get it
to go to an aldehyde and then bash it with conc. sulphuric and sodium
dichromate for another twenty minutes to make it go the rest of the way.
 
Anyhow, there I was carefully following the instructions in the textbook. I
got as far as the aldehyde. At this point the book said "Add 5g [or
something like that] of Na2Cr2O7." I did that. Then it said "Now using a
dropper pippette add 10ml of conc. sulphuric acid..." I did that. Then I
read the rest of the line, and it said: "CAREFULLY, drop by drop over 10
minutes." I lifted my heead to see evil looking bubbles spewing forth from
my pear-shaped flask beneath a growing tower of thick orange fumes. It
looked like something off the set for Jeckyll and Hyde. I have to confess,
I was quite pleased with myself.

Disclaimer:  I didn't write this, I'm just reposting it.

                             THE LAST WORD
                   The Ultimate Scientific Dictionary

Activation Energy: The useful quantity of energy available in one cup of
coffee.

Atomic Theory: A mythological explanation of the nature of matter, first
proposed by the ancient Greeks, and now thoroughly discredited by modern
computer simulation. Attempts to verify the theory by modern computer
simulation have failed.  Instead, it has been demonstrated repeatedly
that computer outputs depend upon the color of the programmer's eyes, or
occasionally upon the month of his or her birth.  This apparent
astrological connection, at last, vindicates the alchemist's view of
astrology as the mother of all science.

Bacon, Roger: An English friar who dabbled in science and made
experimentation fashionable.  Bacon was the first science popularizer to
make it big on the banquet and talk-show circuit, and his books even
outsold the fad diets of the period.

Biological Science: A contradiction in terms.

Bunsen Burner: A device invented by Robert Bunsen (1811-1899) for
brewing coffee in the laboratory, thereby enabling the chemist to be
poisoned without having to go all the way to the company cafeteria.

Butyl: An unpleasant-sounding word denoting an unpleasant-smelling
alcohol.

CAI: Acronym for "Computer-Aided Instruction".  The modern system of
training professional scientists without ever exposing them to the
hazards and expense of laboratory work.  Graduates of CAI-based programs
are very good at simulated research.

Cavendish: A variety of pipe tobacco that is reputed to produce
remarkably clear thought processes, and thereby leads to major
scientific discoveries; hence, the name of a British research laboratory
where the tobacco is smoked in abundance.

Chemical: A substance that:
 1) An organic chemist turns into a foul odor;
 2) an analytical chemist turns into a procedure;
 3) a physical chemist turns into a straight line;
 4) a biochemist turns into a helix;
 5) a chemical engineer turns into a profit.

Chemical Engineering: The practice of doing for a profit what an organic
chemist only does for fun.

Chromatography: (From Gr. chromo [color] + graphos [writing]) The
practice of submitting manuscripts for publication with the original
figures drawn in non-reproducing blue ink.

Clinical Testing: The use of humans as guinea pigs.  (See also
PHARMACOLOGY and TOXICOLOGY)

Compound: To make worse, as in: 1) A fracture; 2) the mutual
adulteration of two or more elements.

Computer Resources: The major item of any budget, allowing for the
acquisition of any capital equipment that is obsolete before the
purchase request is released.

Eigen Function: The use to which an eigen is put.

En: The universal bidentate ligand used by coordination chemists.  For
years, efforts were made to use ethylene-diamine for this purpose, but
chemists were unable to squeeze all the letters between the corners of
the octahedron diagram.  The timely invention of en in 1947
revolutionized the science.

Evaporation Allowance: The volume of alcohol that the graduate students
can drink in a year's time.

Exhaustive Methylation: A marathon event in which the participants
methylate until they drop from exhaustion.

First Order Reaction: The reaction that occurs first, not always the one
desired.  For example, the formation of brown gunk in an organic prep.

Flame Test: Trial by fire.

Genetic Engineering: A recent attempt to formalize what engineers have
been doing informally all along.

Grignard: A fictitious class of compounds often found on organic exams
and never in real life.

Inorganic Chemistry: That which is left over after the organic,
analytical, and physical chemists get through picking over the periodic
table.

Mercury: (From L.  Mercurius, the swift messenger of the gods) Element
No. 80, so named because of the speed of which one of its compounds
(calomel, Hg2Cl2) goes through the human digestive tract.  The element
is perhaps misnamed, because the gods probably would not be pleased by
the physiological message so delivered.

Monomer: One mer.  (Compare POLYMER).

Natural Product: A substance that earns organic chemists fame and glory
when they manage to systhesize it with great difficulty, while Nature
gets no credit for making it with great ease.

Organic Chemistry: The practice of transmuting vile substances into
publications.

Partition Function: The function of a partition is to protect the lab
supervisor from shrapnel produced in laboratory explosions.

Pass/Fail: An attempt by professional educators to replace the
traditional academic grading system with a binary one that can be
handled by a large digital computer.

Pharmacology: The use of rabbits and dogs as guinea pigs.  (See also
CLINICAL TESTING, TOXICOLOGY).

Physical Chemistry: The pitiful attempt to apply y=mx+b to everything in
the universe.

Pilot Plant: A modest facility used for confirming design errors before
they are built into a costly, full-scale production facility.

Polymer: Many mers.  (Compare MONOMERS).

Prelims: (From L. pre [before] + limbo [oblivion]) An obligatory ritual
practiced by graduate students just before the granting of a Ph.D. (if
the gods are appeased) or an M.S. (if they aren't).

Publish or Perish: The imposed, involuntary choice between fame and
oblivion, neither of which is handled gracefully by most faculty
members.

Purple Passion: A deadly libation prepared by mixing equal volumes of
grape juice and lab alcohol.

Quantum Mechanics: A crew kept on the payroll to repair quantums, which
decay frequently to the ground state.

Rate Equations: (Verb phrase) To give a grade or a ranking to a formula
based on its utility and applicability.  H=E, for example, applies to
everything everywhere, and therefore rates an A.  pV=nRT, on the other
hand, is good only for nonexistent gases and thus receives only a D+,
but this grade can be changed to a B- if enough empirical virial
coefficients are added.

Research: (Irregular noun) That which I do for the benefit of humanity,
you do for the money, he does to hog all the glory.

Sagan: The international unit of humility.

Scientific Method: The widely held philosophy that a theory can never be
proved, only disproved, and that all attempts to explain anything are
therefore futile.

SI: Acronym for "Systeme Infernelle".

Spectrophotometry: A long word used mainly to intimidate freshman
nonmajors.

Spectroscope: A disgusting-looking instrument used by medical
specialists to probe and examine the spectrum.

Toxicology: The wholesale slaughter of white rats bred especially for
that purpose.  (See also CLINICAL TESTING, PHARMACOLOGY).

X-Ray Diffraction: An occupational disorder common among physicians,
caused by reading X-ray pictures in darkened rooms for prolonged
periods.  The condition is readily cured by a greater reliance on blood
chemistries; the lab results are just as inconclusive as the X-rays, but
are easier to read.

Ytterbium: A rare and inconsequential element, named after the village
of Ytterby, Sweden (not to be confused with Iturbi, the late pianist and
film personality, who was actually Spanish, not Swedish).  Ytterbium is
used mainly to fill block 70 in the periodic table. Iturbi was used
mainly to play Jane Powell's father.

=3.7 ELEMENTS

___________________________________________________________________________
From: Jason
In a recent contest, The Washington Post asked readers to dream up new
elements for the Periodic Table. Among the best of the batch:

Limbaughium  Lb
The heaviest known element. It possesses an ever-expanding mass. Very
white. Acidic. Emits heat but no light. Instantly polarizes all elements
that come in contact with it. Repels protons and electrons; attracts only
morons.

Billclintium  Bc
With a slick appearance and slimy texture, this element undergoes a
series of interesting changes when in hot water.

Canadium  Eh
Similar to Americium, but a little denser. Much more rigid. Often
called Boron.

Newtium
Extreme irritant. Carries a strong negative charge. Does not possess
magnetic properties. Can be purchased cheaply.

Quaylium  Vp
Einsteinium it ain't.

Budweisium  Ps
Has no taste or smell; is often indistinguishable from water.

Cabmium  Cb
Found in abundance, except when needed. Exists in two states, in
motion and at rest. When in motion, it cannot be stopped, no matter
what you do. Cabmium has a charge associated with it. The charge is
variable, and scientists have not determined the formula for
calculating it.

Politicium  Po
Contains a great deal of gas. Similar to radon in that it can reach
lethal concentrations in the House.

Congress Cg
Atomic number 525. Can never be found in a solution.

Snot  Sn
Bonds forever with corduroy.

From: Blandford
Goldsmitium Rf
Trace amounts found all over country, but not in Europe. Toxic.

From: Vincent Naydenov <VNaydeno@NRCan.gc.ca>
Lewenskium Mo
Bonds extremely well with Billclintium; inspite its effords, can never
get Billclintium to secrete.

Mark A. Mandel
ttto* "Battle Hymn of the Republic"
	*to the tune of

There's a chemical that poses deadly danger to us all
If we don't eliminate it, we are headed for a fall
But our governments refuse to see the writing on the wall
  They're going to let us die!

CHORUS (after every verse):
   Ban dihydrogen monoxide!
   Ban dihydrogen monoxide!
   Ban dihydrogen monoxide
     before it kills us all!

Dihydrogen monoxide is a chemical to fear
Uncounted thousands die of inhalation every year
Yet the FDA allows it in our burgers, beans, and beer
  And never questions why!

In gaseous form it's subtle, without color, taste, or smell
But it's part of acid rain, and it's a greenhouse gas as well
It's also found in car exhaust, which makes our cities Hell
  And dirties up the sky!

It's widely used by industry, and agriculture too
They dump it on the ground or in the river when they're through
And from the ecosystem it gets into me and you
  Which they dare not deny!

You'll find dihydrogen monoxide everywhere you go
In oceans, rivers, lakes, and streams, in air and soil and snow
Its quantitative formula is simply H-2-O
  You'll get it if you try!

......[This verse contributed by Gary McGath]
How far DHMO has spread no one can safely tell.
They've found it on Europa, and it's on our Moon as well.
It may well turn our Solar System to a living hell!
It's filling up the sky!

                BAN DIHYDROGEN MONOXIDE!  THE INVISIBLE KILLER

Dihydrogen monoxide is colorless, odorless, tasteless, and kills
uncounted thousands of people every year. Most of these deaths are
caused by accidental inhalation of DHMO, but the dangers of dihydrogen
monoxide do not end there. Prolonged exposure to its solid form causes
severe tissue damage. Symptoms of DHMO ingestion can include excessive
sweating and urination, and possibly a bloated feeling, nausea,
vomiting and body electrolyte imbalance. For those who have become
dependent, DHMO withdrawal means certain death.

Dihydrogen monoxide:
* is also known as hydric acid, and is the major component of acid
  rain.
* contributes to the "greenhouse effect."
* may cause severe burns.
* contributes to the erosion of our natural landscape.
* accelerates corrosion and rusting of many metals.
* may cause electrical failures and decreased effectiveness of
  automobile brakes.
* has been found in excised tumors of terminal cancer patients.

CONTAMINATION IS REACHING EPIDEMIC PROPORTIONS!

Quantities of dihydrogen monoxide have been found in almost every
stream, lake, and reservoir in America today. But the pollution is
global, and the contaminant has even been found in Antarctic ice. In
the midwest alone DHMO has caused millions of dollars of property
damage.

Despite the danger, dihydrogen monoxide is often used:
* as an industrial solvent and coolant.
* in nuclear power plants.
* in the production of styrofoam.
* as a fire retardant.
* in many forms of cruel animal research.
* in the distribution of pesticides. Even after washing, produce
   remains contaminated by this chemical.
* as an additive in certain "junk-foods" and other food products.

Companies dump waste DHMO into rivers and the ocean, and nothing can
be done to stop them because this practice is still legal. The impact
on wildlife is extreme, and we cannot afford to ignore it any longer!

THE HORROR MUST BE STOPPED!

The American government has refused to ban the production,
distribution, or use of this damaging chemical due to its "importance
to the economic health of this nation." In fact, the navy and other
military organizations are conducting experiments with DHMO, and
designing multi-billion dollar devices to control and utilize it
during warfare situations. Hundreds of military research facilities
receive tons of it through a highly sophisticated underground
distribution network. Many store large quantities for later use.

IT'S NOT TOO LATE!

Act NOW to prevent further contamination. Find out more about this
dangerous chemical. What you don't know CAN hurt you and others
throughout the world. Send email to no_dhmo@circus.com, or a SASE to:

                       Dangers of Hydrogen Hydroxide

From: Nathan F Russell <nrussell@acsu.buffalo.edu> wrote:
I once saw a tank of it the size of a house when I was passing a
military base - supposedly it's used as an engine coolant, but I've
heard there are classified projects that require it as well.  I've
also heard it can be used as a vector for biological weapons.

From: Lois Tilton <ltilton@shell-2.enteract.com>
Even more insidious:  it gets into the atmosphere.

From: Sea Wasp <seawasp@wizvax.net In combination with simple salt,
hydrogen hydroxide can be even more destructive to many metals. Moreover,
it has a bizarre set of chemical and physical characteristics, one of which
makes it incredibly destructive to any structure that's any significant
distance out of the tropics: it *EXPANDS* as it cools to solidification,
something virtually NO other substance known does (most things SHRINK as
they get cooler).

From: Steinn Sigurdsson <steinn@najma.astro.psu.edu>
What is more, one of the few substances that shares this property with
hydrogen hydroxide is a metallic phase of plutonium, coincidence, I think
not.

From: Captain Button <button@eris.io.com>
Additionally, it is also used extensively in nuclear reactors
as the preferred coolant.

From: Nathan F Russell <nrussell@acsu.buffalo.edu>
Hydrogen hydroxide also makes certain other chemicals /far/ more
dangerous than they nornally would be.  In fact, many - of not most -
poisons are dangerous only in combination with it, and some disease
bacteria will become harmless if deprived of it for any length of
time.

Additionally, in the absense of hydrogen hydroxide, I briefly held
caustic soda in my hand with no apparent ill effects at all - though I
was careful to clean the hand very thoroughly afterwards.

From: Nathan F Russell <nrussell@acsu.buffalo.edu>
Not only does it get into the atmosphere, it has probably killed more
people by inhalation than carbon monoxide, nerve gases and other
causes of accidental poison combined!

From: Steve Hilberg <hilberg@tower.cso.uiuc.edu>
What they don't tell you is that it's the most addictive drug on the
market as well.  ... statistics show that almost 100% of all crimes
are committed within a few hours of hydrogen hydroxide ingestion.

From: "Keith F. Lynch" <kfl@KeithLynch.net>
It's widely available even in prisons.  It's smuggled in in "pipes,"
similar to crack pipes only much longer and wider.  The guards don't
even TRY to stop it.

Ironically enough, it's also the primary constituent of the mixture
used for lethal injections.

From: Mike Thoma <mike.thoma@moh.hnet.bc.ca>
The use of this dangerous chemical is so widespread that even the so-called
organic farming industry uses it to speed up the growth of their produce.

From: Jens Kilian <Jens_Kilian@agilent.com>
And they've been doing it for so long (longer than recorded history) that
there are places where the damn stuff *comes out of the ground*!

As for the Greens, I've seen bottled HOH on the tables whenever there is
news coverage of one of their political conventions.  Hypocrites all.

Another note on hydrogen hydroxide:
Public awareness of its hazards in increasing.  It has become unlawful in
most communities to build a house where its concentration in the soil
exceeds specified limits--and yet, in many areas, drilling holes in the
ground to recover it remains not only lawful, but is encouraged!

A student at Eagle Rock Junior High won first prize at the Greater Idaho
Falls Science Fair, April 26. He was attempting to show how conditioned we
have become to alarmists practicing junk science and spreading fear of
everything in our environment. In his project he urged people to sign a
petition demanding strict control or total elimination of the chemical
"dihydrogen monoxide."

And for plenty of good reasons, since:

       1. it can cause excessive sweating and vomiting
       2. it is a major component in acid rain
       3. it can cause severe burns in its gaseous state
       4. accidental inhalation can kill you
       5. it contributes to erosion
       6. it decreases effectiveness of automobile brakes
       7. it has been found in tumors of terminal cancer patients

He asked 50 people if they supported a ban of the chemical.
        Forty-three (43) said yes,
        six (6) were undecided,
        and only one (1) knew that the chemical was water.

The title of his prize winning project was, "How Gullible Are We?"

He feels the conclusion is obvious.

From: Joseph Harper <joeha@microsoft.com>
And here is the same story again with a student from another school: (?)

Idaho Falls, Idaho -- Dihydrogen monoxide causes thousands of drownings
each year, leads to excessive sweating and vomiting and contributes to
land erosion.  And there's nothing anyone can do to stop it.

Fifteen-year-old Nathan Zohner made people aware of that fact by proving
in his science project on critical thinking skills just how vulnerable
people are.

Newspapers, magazines, radio and TV stations, universities, even members
of Idaho's Congressional delegation have been calling Nathan in recent
weeks to talk about the project that won the Greater Idaho Falls Science
Fair in April, the Post Register reported Wednesday.

The project asked 50 ninth graders if the compound called dihydrogen
monoxide should be banned.  Forty-three said yes and six were
undecided.  Only one person was able to tell Nathan dihydrogen monoxide
is just another name for water.

The Skyline High School sophomore said he just wanted to show how easily
people can be misled.

"Some of my friends could have done this.  It wasn't that
extraordinary.  It was just a simple science project that kind of blew
up," he said.

Nathan got the idea after his father, Steven, a nuclear scientist at the
Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, brought home a
flier from an anonymous author describing the "dangers" of dihydrogen
monoxide.

From: TSKephart@aol.com
Here is a funny chemistry story.  Somebody wrote a paper about how this
chemical, dihydrogenoxide has killed over 100,000 people world wide,
usually through inhalation.  The story also went on that if you wash your
food you can never get this chemical off.  No matter what you do you will
be exposed to this very dangerous chemical every day of your life until you
die.  The store finished by claiming that there needs to be a government
research group founded to find a solution.  yada yada yada...anyhow a local
press guy got ahold of this joke, if you haven't figured it out
di-hydrogen-oxide is the correct name for H2O or water.  The deaths that he
was quoting were from drownings.  Anyhow this local guy ran the article in
a paper and started a big outcry for a government study before they
realized what the store was about.....kinda funny chemistry humor

This file is intended to answer typical questions about Water
to reduce traffic on news:alt.drugs.  This FAQ is continually maintained;

                                ANSWERS

1) What is Water?

Water, W, Hot Ice, Liquid Crystal... all these "street" terms refer to the
same substance, known chemically as H20.  Water is a highly addictive and
toxic chemical, which in its natural state is completely odorless,
tasteless, and clear.

2) Is Water dangerous?

Yes.  A scientific survey recently concluded that every creature on earth
contains Water, and almost every creature imbibes more during its life.
Moreover, every animal that has ever ingested this substance has invariably
tried to get more.  Organisms unable to get more Water show signs of
withdrawal, or "dehydration," and eventually die.  Organisms that ingest
more Water inevitably die anyway.
Aside from the biological considerations, remember that Water is composed
of Hydrogen and Oxygen, which are used together as rocket fuel.  Enough
cannot be said about the volatile nature of this chemical.

3) Can I put Water in my bong?

Mixing drugs is never recommended, but if you must attempt this, note the
following:

- Water acts as a coolant and filter.  You are likely to get larger,
  smoother hits than normal.

- Water may actually blend into the smoke, imparting its own qualities
  to the hit.

- Water may splash up and get in your mouth.  Yuck.

4) A FOAF got some laced Water.  How frequently does this happen?

Almost all Water contains some contaminants.  Generally, since Water has no
taste or odor, the presence of either of these may indicate foreign
substances.  Water is so strong, and so cheap to produce, that the story of
the dealer who dusted his grass to make it salable doesn't really apply.

5) How is Water synthesized?

The simplest synthesis is as follows:

-Fill a pot from the kitchen tap.

-Boil for fifteen minutes.

The Water is now suitable for ingestion.

Steve J. Quest gives a more involved recipe yielding a higher-grade
intoxicant:

                   Preparation of Hydrogen Oxide (Water)
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  An Erlenmeyer flask is first filled with a few grams of zinc
  metal chips and is then fitted with a two hole rubber stopper. A
  thistle tube is introduced through one hole and pushed to a
  level where the end of the tube is just above the zinc chips. A
  rubber tube is introduced through the other hole and connected
  to a horizontal copper pipe filled with loose fitting chunk
  cupric oxide.  The other end of the copper pipe is connected to
  a Liebig condenser mounted in a distilling fashion (open end
  pointing down) which is suspended above a capture beaker.

  A bunsen flame is placed under the cupric oxide reaction pipe,
  and any kind of cold liquid is allowed to circulate through the
  condenser.  (some would use cold tap Water, but I can not
  recommend that procedure here due to legalities involved.)

  Sufficient quantities of concentrated sulfuric acid are then
  introduced through the thistle tube to completely cover the zinc
  chips to a level ABOVE the end of the thistle tube. Condensation
  will start to occur within the condenser and run out into the
  beaker.  The crude product represents a technical grade of
  hydrogen oxide, suitable for recreational purposes.

  The reaction sequence is as follows:

  Zn + H2SO4 -> ZnSO4 + H2        H2 + CuO -> Cu + H2O


6) Is homebrewed "bathtub" Water as effective as "the real thing?"

In the author's opinion, "bathtub" Water ("slosh") will never be able to
compete with legendary types like Owsley, Naya, and Perrier, but there is
of course a certain satisfaction in synthesizing your own.

7) What is 'kind' Water?

According to Peter McDermott:

There are actually two major kinds. 'Soft' Water and 'Hard' Water. The
'soft' Water does less damage (to kettles, pipes, etc.)  but the hard Water
is a better hit.

Some people argue that there is something called a 'gatevalve' syndrome,
where some people who begin on the relatively harmless 'soft' Water are
likely to escalate to the hard stuff.  However, this isn't true of every
body.  Personally, I've been drinking soft Water for years without ever
trying anything harder.

8) Are there different types of Water?

Christopher K. Koenigsberg explains:

There are apparently variations in the chemical makeup of W sold in stores,
so someone should look into this for the FAQ (W's still available over the
counter, no prescription necessary, not yet regulated by the FDA, nor
scheduled by the DEA, I guess? How much longer before they catch on? Maybe
we should be more cautious and not talk about it so openly, before they
start having congressional hearings or something?)

For example I've seen W labelled "Steam Distilled" but on the same shelf
also seen W labelled "Drinking Water" and even "Spring Water", and a more
expensive kind for Babies (yes they are even hooking innocent infants) and
there may or may not be differences beyond just the labels and
packaging. There are variations in the price even for the same kind of
stuff, the local store brand is always the cheapest, regional "Artesian
Wells" etc. are more expensive, and the imported kind is most expensive.

There are vending machines outside some grocery stores (hey! you don't even
have to show an ID to prove your age!) which will disburse W either
Distilled or for Drinking, into your own choice of unlabelled container (so
you can pretend it's something else). And the Drinking kind supposedly has
mineral additives. I don't know if this is Strychnine, among the additives,
which maybe causes the cramps when you drink too much, too fast, or too
cold.... but I hear that's just a myth.

9) What is the LD50 of Water?

        Kevin Jernigan, alt.drugs #85634:

I drank Water for the first time at a party last night, and it was great!!
Some of my friends who do W told me about the experience earlier, but I now
realize that it was beyond my wildest expectations.  I was a little bit
scared, at first, because I heard about some of the bad side effects that
it can cause.  A few people said they choked on it, and one guy said that
he dribbled it all over his clothes and got them wet.  Luckily, none of
these things happened to me.  They started passing glasses around to
everyone and I decided to take one

The Water was very clear in color. They said it was scored from a guy who
got it from a spring in Canada.  I don't know whether it was really
Canadian Water, but it was definitely good quality, judging by the color.
I used about 500g of it.  When I put the glass up to my mouth, and
swallowed, the first sensation I felt was of something wet traveling down
my throat.  This sensation started before I had even removed the glass from
my mouth.  I was able to achieve the same feeling again, by taking another
swallow.  As the trip progressed, I noticed several other things.  The W
produced a state of mind that I believe could best be described as a lack
of thirst.  The trip didn't last for very long, but I think that it would
be safe to say that the experience gave me some important insights into my
consciousness.  Chief among these, is the realization that Water can
relieve thirst.


        Ray Mialki, email contribution:

Although I don't partake, some of my neighbours down quite a bit of the
stuff, filling swimming pools and such.  I use it in great moderation, not
even having an outside hose spigot to wash the car with.  Daily showers
seem to be my habitual use.


        Peter McDermott, alt.drugs #unknown:

A recent major survey (n=1) has showed that Water addiction runs in
families.  At present, NIDA funded scientists are working flat out on the
genesis of this crippling condition.

Unlike other addictions, W abuse is believed to affect all sections of
society, rich and poor alike. However, scientists have discovered that a
gene may well be responsible for a predisposition to drinking W.

Although 12 step 'W' recovery programmes have been around for some time
now, major cities have begun to witness a growth in self-help programs for
Adult Children of Waterholics. "Henry" is a member of such a group.

   "Well, I've just got so much rage about this, y'know? I was never
   able to confront them about it at the time. I thought that
   drinking Water was normal.

   Now I'm angry. Ours is a sick culture. The French would never dream
   of exposing their children to 'W' at dinner. There, the kids go from
   breast milk to wine. But every single day, there it was, sitting at
   the dinner table in front of me. Of course, they wouldn't let me have
   any, but after watching them do it, I saw where they got it from. I
   began sneaking to the tap, and taking a sip. Before I knew where I was
   I was into the hard stuff - you know, Water sports. Baths, showers,
   stuff like that.

   Well, eventually, I hit bottom. I out in town and the craving came on
   me and I found myself licking it up from puddles. Then it was toilet
   bowls. There are no wells too deep for the 'W' addict. So I went and
   got help. I've been in recovery for like.. 3 days now, but I wasn't
   making any progress. Then my therapist told me about A CoW and since
   then, it's been nothing but milk. And not mother's milk either..."

However, not everybody accepts that 'W' use is a problem. 'Mary' has been
using 'W' for a month now. She feels that the dangers of 'W' have been much
exaggerated.

   "It's all propaganda, isn't it? I've been doing 'W' for ages now, and
   it's just a bit of a buzz, innit. It's harmless man. There isn't a
   single study that *proves* 'W" has any effect on the bladder, and as
   for people who say it makes you piss. Well, they are just dirty minded.
   As I said, I've been doing 'W' for a month, and I've never had a piss,
   ever.

   We've started a pressure group called 'Fair Play for Water' and
   it's our aim to force the government to tell the truth about 'W'.
   If there are risks, tell us what they are, and how we can minimize
   them.  Prohibition doesn't work. The government knows that. Why
   else would they have repealed the laws against heroin and cocaine?
   Unfortunately, there are political careers to be made out of that
   issue. Vote Libertarian.  Privatise the Water companies. Stop all
   government regulation of Water now!!!!


                 APPENDIX 2:  Street Prices, June 4, 1993

        Chicago, IL, North Shore Area
                -Typical Naya, $1 US per liter.

        Springdale Township, Pennsylvania
                $5 per 1000 gallons.


                   APPENDIX 3:  International Legality Update

In Europe W is becoming something of a threat real fast. I myself have
witnessed tourists trying to score W desperately the last couple of hot
days here this week. As of yet there is no shortage of W, but I've heard
that in Greece it's getting scary.

The police are starting to recognise this situation and have called for
more forces on the street, weeding out W-pushers and sentencing them to
severe punishments straight away!

While sitting in lab the other day, a discussion broke out about weekend
plans. Naturally, these plans consisted mainly of drinking. Or, as one
person referred to it, "killing brain cells". Someone observed that, even
though alcohol supposedly kills brain cells, they seem to do better in
classes during which they regularly take in modest amounts of alcohol than
in classes where they don't. This turned out to be a fairly common
phenomenon.

Since this was during a cell bio class, and we'd been studying biochemical
pathways all day, we started theorizing about different mechanisms of how,
exactly, this works. We came up with two good ones: the "natural selection"
mechanism, and the "exfoliation" mechanism.

The natural selection theory states that drinking: alcohol kills off the
weak, old, and slow brain cells, leaving only the more fit and effective
ones.

The exfoliation theory holds that alcohol removes the old, crusty, dead
layer of brain cells, exposing young fresh ones which are much faster. Sort
of like peeling an onion.

Either hypothesis fits the data, but in order to determine which is the
true explanation, more "field study" will have to be done... such is the
price of science.

By the same token, this business of genes outside of the normal sequence
is difficult.  A great deal of genetic material appears to have no
particular purpose.  There is the standard joke that has geneticists
finally decode some of this material, only to find that some great long
string of codons reads "This space intentionally left blank."

Doctors and veterinarians aren't born knowing all those
fifty-dollar-words they use; there are whole books
devoted to medical terminology.  Most of it is dry, staid
lists of words and definitions, but every now and then,
a bit of the authors' personality shows through.

In "Bailliere's Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary" by
D. C. Blood and Virginia Studdert, the following entry
appears on page 133, right between Brunner's glands and
brush border:

"Brunus edwardii: the urban, companion animal bear, much
admired for its low food requirements and excellent
house training, a high emotional output and complete
freedom from disease.  Called also Ursus theodorus (USA)
and Pooh, Paddington or Brideshead bear (UK)."


(I could add that they may be free from disease, but
they do seem to be susceptible to lacerations requiring
surgical repair...)

Okay, let me see if I've got this right, _Bioinformatics_ is the science of
taking sequential, structural and functional data, developed through years
of tedious and painstaking experimentation by _other_ hard-working
scientists, manipulating the hell out of it with a series of statististical
and computational algorithms, in the hope of presenting grand theories
which you will never have to test yourselves but which will have to be
verified by _other_ scientists at a later date.

data we were seeing was culled from studies of leeches. He said, "Now, a

these creatures are quite fond of them, however. It is also reported that
the leeches often become attached to the researchers."

A seventh grade Biology teacher arranged a demonstration for his class.
He took two earth worms and in front of the class he did the following:
He dropped the first worm into a beaker of water where it dropped to the
bottom and wriggled about. He dropped the second worm into a beaker of Ethyl
alchohol and it immediately shriveled up and died. He asked the class if
anyone knew what this demonstration was intended to show them.

A boy in the second row immediately shot his arm up and, when called on said:
"You're showing us that if you drink alcohol, you won't have worms."

There was this biologist who was doing some experiments with frogs.  He
was measuring just how far frogs could jump.  So he puts a frog on a line
and says "Jump frog, jump!".  The frog jumps 2 feet.  He writes in his
lab book: 'Frog with 4 legs - jumps 2 feet'.

Next he chops off one of the legs and repeats the experiment.  "Jump frog
jump!" he says.  The frog manages to jump 1.5 feet.  So he writes in his
lab book: 'Frog with 3 legs - jumps 1.5 feet'.

He chops off another and the frog only jumps 1 foot.  He writes in his
book: 'Frog with 2 legs jumps 1 foot'.

He continues and removes yet another leg.  " Jump frog jump!" and the
frog somehow jumps a half of a foot.  So he writes in his lab book again:
'Frog with one leg - jumps 0.5 feet'.

Finally he chops off the last leg.  He puts the frog on the line and
teels it to jump. "Jump frog, jump!".  The frog doesn't move.  "Jump
frog, jump!!!".  Again the frog stays on the line.  "Come on frog,
jump!".  But to no avail.

The biologist finally writes in his book:  'Frog with no legs - goes deaf'

reproductive technologies, the paper written about the work will never be
described as seminal.

A trio of biologists were studying fruit flies and attempting to do micro-
scopic observations.  The first put his scalpel to work under the micro-
scope and began to slice.  He successfully chopped the wings off.

The second biologist began to work, and with a bit more effort managed to
slice off the head from the body.  Then the third one went to work, but
nothing visible happened.

His two colleagues looked at him in astonishment.  "What are you going to cut
off?" one of them asked.  His response was:

"You said to cut the fly, so this one won't be having children any more!"

A biology professor was addressing his class, wanting to see if they'd
read the assigned text.  He asked Miss Smith to stand.  She does.

Professor:  Miss Smith, what part of the human body increases ten times
when excited?

Miss Smith blushes and hesitates and giggles.

Proessor:  Miss Smith, please sit down.  Miss Jones, please stand and
tell me if you know what part of the human body increases ten times when
excited.

Miss Jones:  Yes, Professor.  It's the pupil of the eye.

Professor:  Very good.  Thank you Miss Jones, you may sit down.  Miss
Smith, will you please stand again.  (She does)  I have three things to
say to you.
    1.   You have not done your homework
    2.   You have a very dirty mind.
    3.   You're in for a big disappointment.

Dear Dr. Science:
    In order for people to have babies, the female egg has to be fertilized
by the male sperm.  How does the sperm get to the egg?

"It hitchhikes.  There are small arteries (or highways if you will) in the
man's urethra.  Small foreign bodies (or cars, if you will) pull over and
pick up these little spermatozoans (Latin for 'tiny hitchhikers') then
drive over the speed limit as fast as possible before the natural acids in
a woman's body (the highway patrol, if you will) pull the sperm over
reckless driving. ONce they get to the ovum (Latin for garage) they get out
of the car, turn out the lights, lock up, take off their shoes and watch TV
until they fall asleep.  This is where babies come from: small suburban
ranch-style homes hidden deep in a woman's body.  I hope I've answered your
question.  Good luck on your date tonight."
Dr. Science --- http://www.drscience-com/   He knows more than you do!

Several years ago, I read something along these lines on the back page
of Chemical and Engineering News, in the "Postscripts" column.

New embryological research on salamanders has shown that when the optic
nerve is connected to the anus at a very early stage of development, the
organism usually develops into an animal with hindsight. Some of the
animals show symptoms of tunnel vision.

A friend of mine studying medicine once told me this story.

Apparently one day there was a lab where all the students were
learning how to identify various cells. As samples they were
using tissue scraped from the inside of the mouth.

One girl was having terrible difficulties figuring out what kind of cell
she was seeing under her microscope--eventually she called over the
teaching assistant to identify it.

He came over, smirked, and exclaimed, loud enough for everyone to hear,
"Oh wow! That's a sperm cell!"

She was somewhat more careful after that experience....

Herewith a tongue-in-cheek lepidopterists' guide to useful field techniques
(sources are deliberately not credited to maintain our pseudo-reputation as
normal and sane people):

Alpine ambling - highly effective in a flowery alpine meadow on a sunny day;
proper etiquette for watchers and collectors
Arroyo rambling - use this to turn up S. pulverulenta
Blossum bumbling - ideal for A. halesus
Bog bouncing - pursuing Boloria eunomia in bogs; when collecting these in
alpine meadows then shift to alpine ambling
Boulder bounding - this technique is only recommended for young, foolhardy
types who desperately want Oeneis melissa or Boloria alberta
Boulder budging - effective for locating Lycaena cupreus hiding under the
rocks; also useful for wiping out your competing collectors lower on the
slope
Bug mugging - only socially acceptable on small plots of land in large,
crime ridden cities
Bush busting - not sure if this refers to breaking bushes while looking for
bugs or if it refers to breaking bones as a result of blindly leaping over a
low bush and doing a lip stand in a rock pile; reputed to be useful for
pursuing L. bachmanni
Bush whacking - this does not refer to a Mafioso killing a bush ! In western
Canada it is used to describe the odious chore of navigating through dense
woody vegetation. It also describes the technique of striking a bush with
your net handle to flush out the hairstreaks that like to do more walking
than flying
Cliff leaping - a not recommended technique used while chasing Boloria
astarte along cliff tops. The important thing is to not damage your net when
hitting the rocks at the bottom of the cliff.
Cloud forest clogging -never had the pleasure but it sounds like fun
Coulee crawling -bipedal motion often not effective in coulees
Creek creeping - useful adjunct to stream streaking; creep up on the silly
bugs as they puddle in damp areas of a dry stream bed
Cuesta cresting
Desert dawdling - too darn hot to move any faster
Ditch dawdling - drive slowly along road, when you see a butterfly in the
roadside ditch, come to a screeching halt, leap out with net in hand and
give chase; this also works at high speeds on paved highways but it is
recommended that you check your rear view mirror for following traffic.
Fen flitting - useful approach when the fen contains dry hummocks and you
forgot your rubber boots
Flark floundering - what happens when you foolishly try to traverse the
wettest parts of patterned fens
Glade lurking - most enjoyable when accompanied by a chair and a case of
cold beer
Glade sniffing - great for those who have been genetically modified to
detect the pheromones or butterfly armpits; I rely on the sound of the wings
Gulch grubbing - preferred approach to C. nessus
Hide and seek - hide from guerilla's while seeking lepidoptera
Hill hawking - more sedentary method of dealing with hilltoppers than the
strenuous act of ridge running
Hilltop hovering - ideal for a nectar source on a hilltop; pull up a chair
and enjoy - or you can simply levitate if you prefer
Jungle boogie - precipitated by afternoon mosquitoes
Jungle jogging - result of encounters with army ants and wasps
Limestone lounging - for use in alvars and limestone scree
Marsh marching
Mesa moseying - another approach for topographic highs that appropriately
bear the name of this landform
Milkweed milking - proper technique for harvesting Monarch caterpillars
Mountain meandering - stratified random sampling of a mountainside to ensure
all habitats are captured in the dataset
Pampas prancing - South American equivalent to prairie prancing and steppe
stepping
Permafrosting - the technique of jumping into an arctic tundra pond while
pursuing a choice bug, and then slipping on the permafrost bottom. The
tricky part is to net the butterfly just before your head goes under the ice
water, and then keep your net from getting wet.
Prairie prancing - only in North America you say ? a pity !
Puddle pulling - ideal collecting technique for us clever types who realize
that there are places where in fact the mountain will come to Mohammed
Ravine wrestling
Ridge roaming - ideal way to get around and see flutterbugs in the high
country
Ridge running - best for fit folks who like to jog
Roadside romping - by far the most cost efficient and effective method of
sampling butterflies; and besides, everyone knows that the most difficult
decision a biologist must make is: where to stop the truck !
Sage sanitizing - removing the Papilio caterpillars from Artemisia arctica
and Artemisia dracunculus
Scree scrambling - appropriate for novices
Scree skittering - a true art form by accomplished practioners
Scree sliding - fastest way down after a day in the alpine zone
Scrubland scrounging
Seep scooping - used by volume collectors
Seep sifting - used by discriminating collectors to pluck out the choice
morsels
Shale shuffling
Steppe stepping - Asian version of prairie prancing
Stream streaking - describes chases along dry stream beds but note that
clothing is optional :-)
String striding - highly recommended in patterned fens unless you enjoy
being up to your ??? in loon poop
Swamp squelching - unfortunately necessary for those of us who are not yet
able to walk on water
Talus traversing - best done on a large mammal trail unless you have been
conditioned to engage in sidehill gouging
Trail tottering - a proper pace for old folks like me
Trail traipsing - use only with lightweight footwear
Trail tramping - unavoidable with rock boots or equivalent footwear
Trail tripping - quite entertaining when you are not the one doing the
tripping
Tropic traipsing
Tundra trundling - a sensible pace that will keep you on your feet
Tussock tumbling - guaranteed consequence of trying to move quickly in
tussock tundra
Waddle & Scoop - patented technique invented by N. Kondla to sample
butterflies without excessive caloric expenditure
Wayside wandering - only way to get new butterfly records for distribution
mapping without killing yourself bushwhacking or dodging unfriendly private
landowners
Woodland waltzing - this may look like the dance of the demented but it is
only your normal, sane butterfly collector turning round and round after an
Oeneis macounii in a forest opening
Yucca yanking - the only civilized way to acquire M. coloradensis

It is possible that there is a sociobiological explanation for it, but we

This poem was a favorite of Walter Hempfling, Microbiology professor at the
University of Rochester, and one of the finest teachers I ever had.  I
don't know his source.

Two cells of E. coli were wandering slowly
Down the gastrointestinal tract.
An F+ was he, an F- was she,
And their membranes were bound to attract.

Now the dainty F- was born in a sinus
Where her members did seldom trespass,
But the brawnt F+ was spawned in some pus,
And produced both acid and gas.

A kiss he had stolen, down deep in the colon;
"Don't touch me", she said, "or I'll scream!
I have no protection, and an F+ infection
Would spoil my maidenly dream."

So the poor lonely fella withdrew his flagella
And worshipped her from afar;
"At least", he said, "wait, till I can mutate
And come back an HFR."

So this is it,
A few bases to go,

Full of bubbles, they leaked and why I never knew.
But where are the clones?
I've got to have clones,
The end is so near.

Does it look clear?
Contamination is something I always fear.
Are my plaques blue?
They shouldnt be,
No DNA left I'm down on my knees,
So give me some clones?
I've got to have clones,
The end is so near.

I've had bad preps,
There've been quite a few,
Ive tried all brands of PEG, fresh buffers, but nothing would do.
And though they say,
Solutions will keep,
In my hands they last no more than a week.
So send me some clones?
I've got to have clones,
The end is so near.

I've read my gels,
My eyes are quite sore,
There's still sequence missing, of this I am sure.
But there it is!!
Finally done.
I've conquered this fragment and now I have won.
Whats's this I hear?
A voice from the door.
My supervisor wants 10kb more!
So give me some clones,
I've got to have clones,
Or I'll be here all year!

                              ODE TO A CLONE
By John Scalzi (wwwscalzi@aol.com)

(This originally appeared in America Online's "Howdy"
area on March 6th.)

Oh clone, my clone, how can you bear it
To exist knowing you have only one parent?
No zygote you, when haploid cells met
You were produced with a full chromosome set.
And now I can see that you are confused
To discover your genes have arrived slightly used.
To answer your questions is the aim of this poem
You who are like me, my clone, oh my clone.

You were not produced from between sweaty sheets
In fact, you arose from cells scraped off of my cheek.
Your genes gently placed in an egg we provided
And then shocked with a current until they divided.
You sat there a while till it was time to fish
That thing that was you from that petri dish.
(And though it may seem churlish at this time to mention,
we suspect that the dish had post-partum depression).

Oh clone, my clone, don't feel angst or feel grief
Because the genes that you have are not bought but are leased.
You have no mother, but that's no impediment
Indeed, you've bypassed the whole Complex of Oedipus.
To your one parent you can always relate
To do otherwise is a form of self hate.
Who can tell us apart when we answer the phone?
No one at all, my clone, oh my clone.

Think of all the experiences we'll have!
(That is, once they allow you to go from the lab).
I'll take you to places that I've already been
So you can see them once more for the first time again.
Let's go to work, where I think we will find
That we'll get twice as much done in just half the time.
And should we play tennis, our opponents have troubles
As they must play singles, but we shall play doubles.

Oh clone, my clone, I see you are vexed
By ethical issues admittedly complex.
If you are my clone, are you wed to my wife?
And would having two husbands cause marital strife?
Suppose that we clone her? Then what would that be?
Bigamy, polygamy, or polyandry?
Oh, the guilt I would have would go to the bone
If I accidentally slept with your wife, oh my clone.

Perhaps it would be better if we lived all our days
Away from each other -- and go separate ways.
I would stay here and live with my mate
And you would take yours to some other state
Perhaps to Alaska, with Northern Lights blue
To live off the land, in a hut or igloo.
And with a deep sense of pride all my friends would be shown
Many pictures of your house, a Nome clone dome home.

Oh clone, my clone, you impressive feat
The one person born with no help from gametes.
When you have troubles getting yourself to sleep
Do you think on your compatriot, Dolly the sheep?
It's true that we both share our genetic information
But I know that your mind performs its own peregrinations.
In the end I am me, and you are just you alone
You are your own person, my clone, oh my clone.

And each a perfect replica

The followed her to school one day
   which was against the rule.
It made the children laugh and play
   to see her flock at school.
The teacher turned the woolies out
   to wait the bell at four.
But when the children tried to leave
   more sheep had jammed the door.
"What makes those lambs love Mary so?"

(1) A Mad Scientist Christmas

Twas the night before Christmas and all thru my house,
Not a specimen was stirring, not even a louse.
The test tubes were capped and the rat cages closed,
The mold cultures fuzzy, the mice in repose.
The oven kept warm the ebola and pox,
I still need to locate my husband's clean socks...
But that has to wait till tomorrow, I know;
My buggies still need that much more time to grow.

When from the kitchen came a massive explosion,
I leapt from my bed in perpetual motion.
Grabbing my lab coat I pulled on my pants,
Struggling into them a sick sort of dance.
With fury and haste I put on a shirt,
Running out of the bedroom on feet black with dirt.
Buttoning my lab coat and donning a mask,
I ran into the kitchen holding an Erlenmeyer flask.

I nearly passed out when the man who I saw,
dressed in containment gear sealed without flaw,
Held high a huge sack with his arm stiff and straight,
I could tell he must have a hard time with his weight.
Through the mike from his suit he said without pause,
"Ho Ho Ho, Merry Christmas, I'm Hanta Claus!"
Over his shoulder he hefted the sack,
We walked into the living room, I offered a snack.
He took it and smiled, placed the sack by my bench,
Instantly I noticed the Clostridium stench.
Brimming with joy, I cried out with glee,
"Did you bring all of these germies for me?"
"Oh yes," said Hanta, "I must show propriety;
By bringing you microbes, I'm saving society.
"You are the only one who loves these diseases.
Therefore I'm glad to oblige who it pleases."

Delirious with excitement I sat by his side
While he gave me a year's stock of microscope slides,
And pasteur pipettes, drug resistant bacteria,
Such as staph, strep and cultures from the genus Neisseria.

The gleam in my eyes caused the house to be lit,
The moment he gave me a gram-staining kit,
Clostridium tetani, perfringens and sporogenes,
Salmonella typhi and Streptococcus pyogenes!
Plus viruses known to produce hepatitis,
Herpes, and rabies, yellow fever and meningitis!
But that was not all, he had parasites too,
Plasmodia, trypanosomes and schistosomes true!
Tapeworms and roundworms, plague-carrying fleas.
How sincerely generous, Hanta did aim to please!

At long last he said he must now go away,
His sled was experiencing radioactive decay.
"Thanks for the presents," I said, shaking his hand,
"They'll keep me off the streets, you understand."

Hanta Claus smiled and bid me goodnight,
Shouting "Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good blight!"

(2) Hark! The Streptococcus Brings (Melody: "Hark! The Herald =
Angels Sing")

Hark! the Streptococcus brings
Strep sore throat to all who sing,
Chloraseptic doesn't cure it
Other people's sneezing lures it.
If the strep bug has a virus
Scarlet fever then arises,
Cross reaction with the heart
Causes it to come apart,
Hark! the Streptococcus totes,
Toxin and fire to all it smotes.

Pneumonia makes you cough and wheeze,
Mucus fills the lungs with sleaze
A viscous greenish oozing cloak,
That causes you to gasp and choke
Without water you can drown
If you breathe the strep germ down
Hark! The Streptococcus breeds
The misery of a bad disease

Of fecal strep in food beware,
Methane gas befouls the air,
Speedily you drop your pants
As if they held live fire ants
On the toilet you are dying
Bent in pain, guts liquefying
Hail! the Streptococcus means

O Humid Night
Anopheline mosquitoes
Are circling you in the hope of a meal.
She takes a bite, saliva from her mouthparts
Drool parasites which you can't see or feel

Your brain can get sick,
You will have a coma
After the rage and the headaches have passed
You're veggie soup, home to protozoa,
Mosquito lands, time to go home at last..

Fall on your knees,
Pale, burning with fever
Plasmodia
Are in your blood, were in your spleen
Malaria
There's no real cure, just in your dreams...

(4) Away in a Test Tube (Melody: "Away in a Manger")

Away in a test tube
My plague cultures grow
On nutrient agar
Mankind's greatest foe

It's easy to grow them
If one does it right
At thirty-five Celsius
All day and all night

Once they are ready
You can let them go
To sicken the masses
With pus-filled buboes.

     My Cold

You became part of me,   
just when, I'm not quite sure.   
Most Likely in the subway,   
where the air is not so pure.   

Borne by airborne droplets,   
sprayed out by some sneeze,   
from some afflicted victim,   
then carried by the breeze.   

First my throat was sore.   
Now my nose is streaming.   
Viri in my head and chest,   
Their numbers must be teeming.   

It seems unthinkable   
that such a tiny sphere   
300 Angstroms wide   
has left me lying here.   

But, I know this is an old war   
my body's fought before.   
Little does this virus know   
what there is in store.

    
    
In my spleen the leucocytes   
issued with their warrant,   
spill out into my blood   
and are carried by the torrent.   

Into all capillaries   
and annexes they stray,   
seeking virus O-1-4   
until they find their prey.   

"Feed a cold" someone said.   
I ate and drank my fill.   
Knowing that more leucocytes   
would go in for the kill.   

Now I am much better.   
My head is feeling clear.   
A day in bed to sweat it out   
has brought the end quite near.   

Here is the epilogue:   
Just when I thought I'd won,   
I looked up at Fabienne   
and knew I'd passed it on!

A couple of years ago I bought The Biochemist's Songbook. It's great! It's
got all major biological pathways described and set to the tune of
popular (folk) songs.

Allright, I'll give an example....

*** Protein Synthesis *** (tune: My Bonnie Is Over The Ocean )

The primary sequence of proteins
Is coded within DNA
On the sense strand of the double helix
coiled antiparallel way

(chorus:)
Intron and exons
changes are posttranscriptional, and all
Glycosylations
Don't alter such basics at all

(... and so on for about 15 stanzas. The synthesis of proteins from DNA is a
complex pathway....)

One of my favourites:

*** The Michaelis Anthem *** (tune: The Red Flag)

The substrate changed by an enzyme
Initially, in unit time
Varies, if not in excess
With substrate concentration, [S]
If enzyme concentration's low
And reaction back from product's slow
Then if we choose a steady state
Velocity and [S] relate.

This relationship can be derived
As Briggs and Haldane first contrived:
The unbound enzyme, [E], we guess
Is [E0] (total), less [ES]
k1[S][E] gives [ES] formation
and k2[ES], dissociation
And [ES] gives the product, P,
At a rate that's [ES] times k3

When [ES] is at the steady state
These terms are all seen to relate
([E0] less [ES]) times k1[S]
Equals (k2 + k3) times [ES]
Now the maximum velocity
is k3[E0], (or big V)
These terms can be manipulated
If one more definition's stated

Define as Km (just for fun)
(k2 + k3) on k1
And note that v (velocity)
Is always [ES] times k3
Then rearranging these equations
We get the final rate equation
V times [S] on Km + [S]
is v (initial) - more or less


OK, one more taster....

*** The Respiratory Chain *** (tune: Battle Hymn of The Republic)

My eyes have seen the glory of respiratory chain
In every mitochondrium intrinsic to membranes
Functionally organised in complex sub-domaines
Where electron flow along

(chorus)
Glory, glory respiration
Glory, glory respiration
Glory, glory respiration
Where electrons flow along

(etc., etc.)

Behold the mighty dinosaur,
Famous in prehistoric lore,
Not only for his power and strength,
But for his intellectual length.
You will observe from these remains
The creature had two sets of brains;
One in his head, the usual place,
The other at his spinal base.
Thus he could reason a priori
As well as a posteriori.
No problem bothered him a bit
He made both head and tail of it.
So wise was he, so wise and solemn,
Each thought filled a spinal column.
If one brain found the pressure strong
It passed a few ideas along;
If something slipped his forward mind,
'T was rescued by the one behind.

    THE NIGHT BEFORE DEFENCE
   (or A Visit From Citrate)

Twas the night before defence, when all through te lab
Not a gel box was shaking, with stain or with MAb;
The columns were hung in the cold room with care,
In hopes that my protein, I soon could prepare;

The post-docs were nestled all smug in their beds,
While extracts of barley muddled their heads;
With the tech in the suburbs and PI the same,
I had just settled down to another video game.

When out of the fridge there arose such a clatter
I sprang from the terminal to see what was the matter.
Away to the cold box, I flew like a flash
But the stench was o'erpowering and I threw up beef hash.

The mould on the dampest of walls were cold
Had the softness of kittens only seven weeks old;
When what to my view, a thing I despise
But a half eaten sandwich and four tiny mice;

With a little old scientist, so lively and galling,
I knew at a glance was Linus Pauling.
More vapid than undergrads, his charges they came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them rude names.

"Now, Watson! Now Francis! You strange little modellers!
On Luria! On Bertani! You stupid old broth'lers!
To the top of the bench, to the top of the wall!
Purify! Purify! Purify all!"

As dry heaves before the commitee meeting, bend
A young student's body and his colon distend,
So up their earlobes, acytes they grew,
With a sack full of antibodies, their skin turning blue.

And then, for a second, I heard from the 'fuge,
An unbalanced rotor spinning something too huge.
Where I put down my hand, to better hear the sound,
Came the snapping of sparks from a wire sans ground.

Pauling's hair was al wavy, and I thought I must be sick
`Cause the curls in his hair looked just like a helix.
On an arm load of oranges, he started to snack
An I recalled his fetish with citrate, the quack.

His eyes were all wrinkled, but the cheeks were yet red;
Not too shabby for a man who was several years dead;
The leer of his smile was just a tad scary
And the snow on his rooftop made his head yet quite hairy;

The end of a pipette, he held in his teeth
And a pile of kimwipes lay around his big feet.
He held a small vial of something quite gel-ly,
A mercaptan no doubt, for it make him quite smelly.

He changed `round the columns, adding to the confusion
And I laughed to spite my own paranoid delusion.
A wink of his eye and a rotation of his head,
Told me whatever I drank would soon leave me dead.

He spoke not a word, just buggered up my work,
And dried all my resins, that silly old jerk.
And separating his middle finger from first, fourth and third,
That crazy, old bugger, just flipped me the bird.

He grabbed up his cohorts and ran down the hall,
And away they all flew, letting me take the fall.
That is why, dear Commitee, I am sorry to say,
I need a five year extension, starting today.

There was a biology student who was studying equilibrium in sea birds with a
specific focus on terns. He proposed that giving measured doses of THC (from,
of course, marijuana) and observing their flight patterns would give some
insight to the problems of equilibrium in three dimensional space. This
proposal being given in a more liberal era, the student got the funding. He
filled out mountains of forms, set up a lab with a ready supply of terns, and
proceeded on his way. After a year of diligent work, groveling monthly before
the review committee to get his stipend, and living with drugged terns, he
completed his study.

With trembling hands, he delivered his 247-page report, complete with charts
and graphs, to the review committee. The august body peruses his study, asking
penetrating questions and reducing our student to jell-o. Finally, the
department head rises. The light reflects off her steel rimmed glasses as she
stares down at our student.

"There is a lot of good work here," she says. "But we can't accept this report.
You have detailed marvelously the effects of THC on terns but you forgot one
essential step: you have no control group." Our student turns pale and says,

Two guys, called Joe and Dean, were fishermen.  Every day, before dawn,
they set out to sea with their crews, coming home late in the evening with
their catches of fish.  Now, there was one particular area where they would
cast their nets, because of a particular type of fish which was to be found
there.  This was a mutant type of fish which had no hearing apparatus.
These rare fish fetched a high price from the local marine biologists who
liked to study them.  Now, the area where Joe and Dean caught these fish
was very difficult to reach, and involved long hours of sailing through
treacherous waters, which Joe didn't like at all.   Well, one week, Joe
didn't turn up for work at all, and when one of his crew went to Joe's
house to find out what was wrong, Joe said, "I don't know what's wrong with
me.  I'm feeling really tired and lethargic.  I have no energy at all."
"Don't worry," said the crewman, "Dean has been putting all his catch of
those mutant fish through as yours, so you will still have some money to
pay our wages this week."  "Oh, no," said Joe.  "That means that I will
have to get over this feeling of exhaustion and go out to that awful bit of
the sea next week, and all because -

step backward.  After eons of enlarging anatomical development, to deal
with harsh environments such that the female may brood in safety and
security, a human male has now started us down the road to where our half
of the species is obsolete.  Just as the Western females of the species
were discovering the early mortality and rampant disease that had largely
been the male domain, they have now been introduced to a system whereby
much of their stress can be alleviated through the removal of the male
population from the gene pool.  FBI agent Clarissa would have been happy to

That's interesting, because my father was a self-made man in the
truest sense of the word.  He enucleated an egg cell from a donor,
micro-injected a nucleus from one of his own pluripotent stem cells,
and implanted it in a psuedopregnant female goat.  After gestation, he
delivered himself and educated himself.  Of course his fortune was
largely willed to him by himself, but he had made that before, so it
was okay.  And to this day, he prides himself on his integrity, his
compassion, and his ability to eat tin cans.

                                COW SYSTEM:
                  Transgenic protein purification system

                            Instruction Manual

Introduction to Cow System(TM):
The Cow cloning system is an advanced protocol for the purification of
recombinatn proteins from lactating bovine species.  The system is more
reliable than current sheep cloning methods, requires less starting
material, is less expensive and will not cause public controversy when the
press get holds of it.

1) Description:
The Cow System(TM) is the most powerfull system for the cloning and
expression of recombinat protein.  Target genes are cloned in clow plasmids
under control of the bovine serum albumin promotor.  The desired product
can comprise more than 10% (50kg) of the animal after a few hours of
fermentation, in inclusion bodies.

2) Host for cloning:
Suitable cows for cloning include the Cowalbi, which are albino, and allows
the black/white screening for the library when plated on the suitable field
spread with X-Grass(TM) (GG) selective medium.  Note that the Scottish
Highland Cows (SHC) are more sensitive to the heat shock transformation.

3) Preparation of the medium:
You need a very, very big flas (two million liters), a very, very big
shaker and a clothes peg for your nose.  The growth medium, "Cow Dip" or
C.D. broth, is made from @m grass, 0.5M hay supplement, 0.2mM ice cream
(vanilla flavour), pH7.2.  An oxygen carrier, such as myoglobin, can be
added to increase growth and prevent drowning.  Alternatively, Farmer
Seah(R) provide bovine aqualungs for growth in liquid media.  Always,
autoclave the medium in order to kill scrapie prions.

4) Transformation:
You need alt least 12kg of plamid, a vet and a big swimming pool at 37C and
a sauna at 42C. It is possible to use the FarmerKit(TM) from Farmer
Seah(R).  Supercompetent Cowalbi calves are provided with the kit.
Recently, a protocol derived from Maniatis has been described by Jersey et
al. (1996) using Brute Force(TM) on mature bovine.

a- Place the cows in a room on ice and mix gently to assure that the cows
are in good shape.
b- Add 2kg of plasmid directly in each cow using a clean glove.  Rotate
gently to mix.
c- Place cows on ice for 30 minutes.
d- Heat shock the cows by placing them in the sauna at 42C for exactly 40
seconds.  Do not vortex; the cows will break the mixer.
e- Place the cows in a cold room for 2 minutes.
f- Add two million liters of GG medium.
g- Incubate the cows at 37C with shaking in Earthquake zone for one hour
and spread the cows on a green field(*).  Note that premade libraries are
available from Cowtech (Cambridge).

5) Expression:
a- To start the culture, add two tonnes of transformed cows (0.25 vol. of
total bovine prep (TBP)) in the liquid culture (figure 1)
b- Incubate with shaking the culture at 37C until OD_600 of the supernatant
reaches 0.8.
c - The cows could be separated by decantation using a shepherd and his
dog, by gentle centrifugation (5g) of filtration (filter, 1m).
d- Lyse by osmotic shock in 2M Chocolate Syrup(**) or with three medium
shrapnel devices.  Atomic weapons are not advised.  Note that English cows
are very resistant to lysis.  It is possible to use a French Press.
e- Purify the product using normal procedures.  For enhanced purification,
use the Cow-Lyse Kit(TM).

6) Cloned gene expression in Cow System(TM)
The plasmid included with this kit is the new pBSE, the Bovine System
Expression plasmid.  Other Cow-based expression systems can be used but may
not over-express to the same extent.
When cloning chimaeric gene constructs, remember to use Cowalbi which are
missing the gene coding for the restriction enzyme BDNA I.  Cowalbi are
also immunosuppressed to aid expression of hideously deforming genes.

If gene products are poor, try the Rhino Kit(TM).  This incorporates a
grey/white selection procedure to replace the Blue Whale Kit(TM), which has
been discontinued due to poor yields and international pressures.

(*) Single cloned cows could be stored as frozen at -80C or in a field in
Greenland.
(**) Note that the use of chocolate syrup osmotic shock can lead to
milkshake production in certain bovine species.
(***) pMooscript can be used instead for lower expression levels.

                           WHEN PUSH COMES TO SHOVE

Not to be outdone by their Highland brethren and Dolly, the Andean
Association for Animal Science has recently announced the results of their
most stunning achievement to date.  Following on the heels of the nuclear
tranplantation experiments which generated a cloned sheep, a group of
Chilean researchers have used the technology of embryo fusions to generate
the world's first Pushme-Pullyou, famed from the many novels of the
adventures of Dr. Doolittle.  This creature has the forelimbs and heads of
two individuals at opposite ends.  Due to the genesis of this animal, the
Chilean group regrets that Butthead, as he is affectionately known, lacks
any reproductive organs.  Needless to say, Butthead is a very sad and bored
animal.

The same group was rather evasive about the results of the other half of
the embryonic fusion experiments and there is an unconfirmed report that
the other creature escaped from its pen and was last seen running for
political office in Canada.

A reprint of some articles in newsgroups similar to the cloning debate.

Excerpted from the bio.plants.monk newsgroup:
"I say to you all that we must stop the insanity before it is too late.
What our Brother Gregor has been doing recently in the rectory garden is
sacrilegious and dangerous for the general population.  I mean, what
self-respecting Brother of the cloth would stoop, literally and
figuratively, to determine the colour and texture of peas?  Can he not see
where this will lead?  Next thing you know, he will be doing experiments
with chickens and horses.  And from there, chaos.  If the good lord had
wanted these plants to mate, he would have made them all one colour...  I
imagine a beige of a nice taupe.  There is a reason that these peas are a
different colour and texture and that is because God said it should be so
and we should stop Brother Gregor before he brings His wrath down on us."

Excerpted from the sci.chem.h-bond newsgroup:
"I'm telling you that this recent discovery by Drs. Watson and Crick will
be the end of us all.  Now that they have elucidated the structure of DNA,
there is no end to what some crackpot can do with this technology.  Think
of it.  If this really is the stuff that makes us what we are, what is to
prevent the crazies from looking further at it and finding out that we're
not all that different after all.  Not that I'm e prejudiced, you all
understand, but it would be the end of civilization to find out that 'l
share the same basic coding sequence with people like Siam and Rhodesia.
It just would't do, you see.  And heaven forbid that they find this out.
They might expect to be treated like us, and we certainly can't have that.

another succesfull day.  As they rode the local transit on their way home,
they began a rather animated discussion about the day's results and more
specifically about the success that one had with her gel retardation or
mobility shift assays.  On and on they went about the "retards" doing this
and the "retards" doing that when a woman across the aisle from them
finally turned in disgust and said: "The word is mentally handicapped and
it's not very nice to call them retards."  The two scientist were shocked
by this sudden outburst and the woman got off of the train before the two
could correct her on the subject to which they were referring.

                             The Cutting Edge

In a protein lab, it is common for people to set up their proteins as a
fusion with other domains which are easily purified through their affinity
to ligands attached to resin beads.  One of the most common of these
domains is the glutathione S-transferase protein or GST.  Typically, there
is a small linker region between the protein of interest and the fusion
parner and this amino acid sequence contains recognition sequences for
proteases.  After months in the lab, having limited success with her
proteolysis reactions, a young female grad student finally had her patience
and perseverence pay off when she destained yet another gel and saw that
her protein had indeed been cut by the protease.  In her joy, the young
woman ran out into the hallway, proclaiming proudly to all:
  "I've got cleavage.  I've got cleavage.  Come over here.  Look at my
cleavage."

                              A Graphic Plot

In another lab, on another day, yet another young, female graduate student
was working on a poster for presentation at an upcoming meeting.  She had
been using fluorescence to study the binding of a protein to its ligand and
had spent quite a bit of time getting just the right distribution of data
points for her graph.  After several days in front of the fluorimeter and
hours in front of the computer, plotting her data, she sat back in
satisfaction at her accomplishments.
Seeing one of the guys from her lab passing in the hallway, she called out
to him in a loud voice, "Hey come look at my figure.  Are these outstanding
curves or what?"  They were nice curves and she had a really nice figure.

Toronto (ATP): Reports are slowly filtering in about an incident in a
Toronto lab where one technician found that extra hand which he had
requested from his boss, even though Human Resources was not involved.
They say that good help is hard to find, but not if you simply dig a little

                            THE ICE MAN COMETH

Here's a story that'll frost your test tubes.  The lab had been operational
for several years when the technician decided that they were going to need
to be able to put more than two sample boxes in the lab's -70 C freezer.
Unfortunately, this was going to mean cutting through several feet of ice.
As well, there was the serious danger of drowning as the ice began to melt
into the lab.  Thus, equipped with a hair dryer, hipwaders and aqualung,
the technician pulled the plug from the outlet and went to lunch while
waiting for the ice to begin to melt.  (As an aside, please note the use of
the hair dryer... this is how men defrost a freezer, unlike many women I
have known who attack the ice with a knife or screwdriver, often leading to
punctured freon tanks and larger ozone holes.)

Returning from lunch, the technician spent the first half hour apologizing
profusely to the graduate student whose sequencing gel he had turned off
when he pulled the plug for the power pack instead of the one for the
freezer.  After that, he pulled the correct plug and spent the next several
hours with the hair dryer pointed into the freezer and carefully pulling
small glaciers from the shelves and sides of the freezer.  As he proceeded
deeper and deeper into the various icy strata, the history of the lab began
to unfold.  Within the first foot, he began to uncover the now-soggy
cardboard storage boxes of the recently graduated students, unearthing
(de-icing?) a couple of years worth of work and a number of plasmid vectors
which the lab had given up on finding and had long ago reordered from the
supplier.  An hour or so into the work, he began to scrape the second foot
of ice away and saw initial signs of a large package under the ice, but the
frosting of the ice prevented him from immediately determining what it
was.  In the meantime though, he was able to free up some radiolabeled ATP
which was now colder than it's environment and there was a vial of
C14-labelled amino-acids which must have been a remnant of an early life
and defied dating even with the most modern techniques.  Another layer
down, and on his third sink of ice, the technician got closer to the
unidentified object locked in its frosty grave.  On the way, he then began
to pull out more sample boxes of people whose names the could't recognize
and small brown vials containing enzymes with a best before date which
predated him... not the date of his hiring, but his own age.  But still,
the icy object eluded extraction.

As afternoon gave way to evening, the technician could begin to make out
details on the alien in the freezer and he quickly began to realize that
the poor thing had a human form.  He increased his pace but still spent
several hours removing more ice before he could begin to free the poor
person from the ice.  Finally, he had removed enough that an arm fell free
of the ice and the hair dryer began to warm the flesh.  In less than an
hour, he had removed the last of the ice and the body fell to the floor,
shivering.  As the body warmed, its lips moved as though trying to speak.
It was another hour though, before words began to form.  The tech asked the
young man what had happened.  Slowly, and with great effort, the young
scientist began to speak.

"I was on my way to the freezer to get some more DNA for my crystallization
trials -- I think that I'm close to getting a structure, you know -- when I
got trapped.  I know I should have been using gloves, but I was in a
hurry.  I grabbed for a box at the back of the freezer when my arm hit the
side and got stuck.  Quickly the ice crystallized around me and someone
later came by, saw the door open and closed it without seeing that I was in
there.", he said, still shivering.  "By the way, how are McCarthy hearings
going, anyway?"

This was not going to be an easy one to explain to the boss.

                                  Cabin Fever

Every so often, a lab citizen can be struck with what is commonly referred
to as cabin-fever.  This condition often leads to a display of bizarre
behavior by the afflicted individual, often riveting the attention of
lab-mates and bystanders alike - (most disconcerting to the PI, general
progress in the lab can be severely affected).  Of course, it is well known
that these temporary bouts of lunacy are exacerbated by many things such as
malfunctioning fume-hoods, looming committee meetings, sub-cloning, and
gloves that cut off the circulation to the rest of your body.  But the
origin of this dangerous yet entertaining behavior is almost invariably
linked to sensization to the lab environment, usually as a result of
excessive experimentation.  Although the laboratory strain of cabin-fever
is not necessarily contagious, exposure can be dangerous.  (Sadly, even
pipette tips are harzardous when they fall into the wrong hands.)  For this
reason, we at *Aliquotes* have endeavored to provide you with some warning
signs that may protend a possible breakdown.  According to our guidelines,
it is advisable to vacate the lab if you notice your labmate doing any of
the following:

* Suddenly screams "Don't touch my tweezers!  I swear to (insert
  PC-sanctioned deity here) I'll *kill* you if you even look at my tweezers
  again!".
* Spends the morning penciling in her name for all 365 days on the sign-up
  calendar by the HPCL machine.
* Starts extending the use of yellow post-it notes to delineate new
  territory in the lab.
* Is observed cradling a stir-bar while quietly muttering "They'll never
  get you my dear, you're my special one, my one and only and they can
  never take you away from me..."
* Takes his coffee break underneath is desk.  (Same place he keeps his
  tarot cards and palmistry book.)
* Roots around the garbage sobbing, "No, No! Come back!"
* Sits in front of the computer for days, endlessly changing the background
  colour on his slides.
* Looks up dirty words in the Swiss-protein data bank.
* Requires sunglasses if the curtains are opened in the lab.
* Starts an elbow fight with you because you are pipetting on her side of
  the lab.
* Autoclaves articles of your clothing when you don't strictly adhere to
  the schedule on the sign-up sheet.
* Scrawls the words "Lab Police" in magic marker on the back of his lab
  coat and starts using the butt of his pipetteman as a tool for law
  enforcement.

In development,
     A new musical by
           Andy Wirld-Whyde Webber

                                   YUSEF
                    And the amazing Technicolor Labcoat

   The story of a lonely MSc who is doted on by his supervisor, raising the
jealousy of his lab mates.  To show his pleasure with Yusef, the supervisor
creates for him a special lab coat covered with a variety of stains and
this technicolor lab coat sends his mates wild.  While on their way to a
lab products show, they trap Yusef in a cold room and sell him as summer
student labour to a passing post-doc.  Yussef works dutifully for his new
master until another post-doc in the same group covets Yusef but Yusef
rejects her advances.  This second post-doc is angered by Yusef's rebuff
and buggers up the work of the first post-doc, blaming it on Yusef.
   Yusef is then chained to his bench as a volunteer labourer until one
day, the Chair of the department walks by bemoaning a sub-cloning problem.
Yusef offers a piece of advice involving plasmid methylation and the Chair
tells his graduate students to check it out.  They succesfully sub-clone
the fragment and it turns out to be a novel gene.  To express his
gratitude, the Chair frees Yusef from his fetters and takes him under his
wing as protege.  Eventually, the Chair runs off to form his own compagny
and takes Yusef with him as Head of Research and Development.
   Years later, the lab mates from Yusef's original lab are about to finish
their degrees when their supevisor's grants run out and they are
destitute.  Yusef's old supervisor sends them to seek their fortunes in the
mystical land of Industry where they accidently meet on Yusef's doorstep.
They do not recognize Yusef although he knows them, but he takes pity on
them and sends for the old supervisor.  They are happily reunited and all
receive their degrees and, eventually, are tenured at al nearby university.

                          Ovulation versus cretinism

Two different theories exist concerning the origin of children: the theory
of sexual reproduction, and the theory of the stork. Many people believe in
the theory of sexual reproduction because they have been taught this theory
at school.

In reality, however, many of the world's leading scientists are in favour
of the theory of the stork. If the theory of sexual reproduction is taught
in schools, it must only be taught as a theory and not as the truth.
Alternative theories, such as the theory of the stork, must also be taught.

Evidence supporting the theory of the stork includes the following:

1. It is a scientifically established fact that the stork does exist. This
can be confirmed by every ornithologist.

2. The alleged human foetal development contains several features that the
theory of sexual reproduction is unable to explain.

3. The theory of sexual reproduction implies that a child is approximately
nine months old at birth. This is an absurd claim. Everyone knows that a
newborn child is newborn.

4. According to the theory of sexual reproduction, children are a result of
sexual intercourse. There are, however, several well documented cases where
sexual intercourse has not led to the birth of a child.

5. Statistical studies in the Netherlands have indicated a positive
correlation between the birth rate and the number of storks. Both are
decreasing.

6. The theory of the stork can be investigated by rigorous scientific
methods. The only assumption involved is that children are delivered by the
stork.

Received from Poor Innocent Guy Bernard of Sennett, New York:

Scientists and God

 One day a group of Darwinian scientists got together and decided that man
had come a long way and no longer needed God. So they picked one Darwinian
to go and tell Him that they were done with Him.

 The Darwinian walked up to God and said, "God, we've decided that we no
longer need you. We're to the point that we can clone people and do many
miraculous things, so why don't you just go on and get lost."

 God listened very patiently and kindly to the man. After the Darwinian was
done talking, God said, "Very well, how about this? Let's say we have a
man-making contest." To which the Darwinian happily agreed.

 God added, "Now, we're going to do this just like I did back in the old
days with Adam."

 The Darwinian said, "Sure, no problem" and bent down and grabbed himself a
handful of dirt.

God looked at him and said, "No, no, no. You go get your own dirt!!!!"

A recent survey by the U.S. National Science Foundation found that
52% of the respondents believe that the earliest human beings
lived at the same time as the dinosaurs.

Once again it is time to vote on "scientifical correctness" and
help the scientific community decide which side of various issues
it should accept as "correct".

Please check only one:

13% Dinosaurs and man walked together millions of years ago.
06% Dinosaurs and man walked together less than 10,000 years ago.
61% Dinosaurs and man walked together, but it was purely platonic.
14% Dinosaurs became extinct before the first humans existed.
06% Humans became extinct before the first dinosuars existed.

prehistoric times, they rarely if ever walked together. When they
were going in the same direction, the human invariably choose to
ride."

Investigator John J. Lannutti concludes that, currently,
"dinosaurs mostly fly while man mostly walks."

Investigator Jim Culter concludes that dinosaur bones were placed
in the fossil strata 10,000 years ago in order to confuse and
mislead 20th century scientists, and that dinosaurs never actually
existed.

Investigator Frank Stephan raises a concern common to the German
scientific community, in reporting, "This vote is placed in the
belief, that alligators do not count as dinosaurs in spite of the
fact that these two species are relatives. But in this case it was
more a hating than loving relationship."

                             Dating Dinosaur Bones
Some tourists in the Chicago Museum of Natural History are marveling at
the dinosaur bones. One of them asks the guard, "Can you tell me how old
the dinosaur bones are?"

The guard replies, "They are 73 million, four years, and six months old."

"That's an awfully exact number," says the tourist. "How do you know
their age so precisely?"

The guard answers, "Well, the dinosaur bones were seventy three million
years old when I started working here, and that was four and a half years
ago."

Back in the 40s or 50s a young dinosaur hunter excavated some fossilized
tracks in Texas (I believe). His work was being funded in part by an
eccentric philanthropist. A nearby small town had a pawn shop which
displayed in it's window a block of stone with a human footprint
purportedly recovered from the same locale as the dinosaur prints. The
human print was an obvious carved fake but the paleontologist took a
picture of it and used it as the frontispiece in a book he published
because it was the kind of far-fetched item that would appeal to his
benefactor. It seemed a harmless joke until creationists picked up on it
and used it as an example of a respected scientist proving the coexistence
of humans and dinosaurs. Don't remember where I read this but it may have
been in one of Stephen Jay Gould's essay collections.

That's it! A hominid a long time ago was named Occeam. He invented a flint
cutting tool and shaved his skin. Everyone else adopted Occeam's Razor and
started shaving. Becuse of that, the fat layer was needed to keep warm, now
that the fur coat was removed. Over time, people died of shaving cuts so a
selective advantage came from not having the fur to shave in the first place.

How long ago were sharpened flint tools made? Given all the problems found
with AAT but Occeam's Ape Theory is so much simpler, if we apply Occeam's
Flint Axe, we see that the simpler is more likely when no evidence exists,
like the god debate.

And that's the Homo Erectus Occeamus theory.

This is lifted from a serious articicle "A laymen's explanation of
evolution" - Joachim Verhagen.

This essay was originally posted on July 24th 2000 in response to a Biblical
creationist who misunderstood evolutionary theory so badly that he used the
following example in an attempt to refute it:
"If you put automobile parts in a box and shake it up for a trillion years,
you will not get an automobile".

I have since heard other creationists define evolution as a collection of
single cells that suddenly, intentionally, and purposefully amassed
themselves directly into a human being while other separate cell groups
independently evolved into reptiles, birds, fish, etc.  Another creationist
also described a single individual fish suddenly growing legs and walking
within one lifetime. Another demanded that if evolution were true, why
didn't horses sprout wings to escape predators?

That reminds me of the cladist's weird world.  They assume that the
ancestral species becomes extinct in a speciation event and two daughter
species are born, but they concede that one of these two daughter species
is actually the ancestral species.  They call this an "asymmetrical split."

I will give a sociological example of the type of thinking cladists
practice below:

The world according to cladism:

A cladist's wife is pregnant.  One day she is experiencing labor pains.
The cladist calls an ambulance.  His wife and him arrive safely at the
hospital.  After a few hours of pacing back and forth in the waiting room,
the doctor congratulates the cladist: "Congratulations, you have two new
daughters."  The cladist asks the doctor in excitement: "Doctor, does that
mean that I have twin daughters?"  The doctor answers, "No, there was no
symmetrical split.  Instead, there was an asymmetrical split.  That means
one of your daughters is 25 years older than the other one, but your wife
seems to be missing."

The US Air Force originally started as a single company in the Corps of
Engineers (fact).  As it grew larger and more complex this caused problems
since a company only has four platoons each of four squads, so to
accommodate increasing complexity cladists had to introduce superplatoons,
subplatoons, infraplatoons, parvplatoons, supersquads etc.

Finally somebody thought this was getting ridiculous, so he proposed
removing the Air Force from the Army and making it a separate service.
However, all the cladists protested: No, no, You mustn't do that, it would
make the Army paraphyletic!

SCIENTIFIC STUDY
The Cameron Column #41

In an extraordinary new scientific study which answers the question,
"are we giving scientists too much money to investigate this kind of
stuff?" researchers have determined that providing rats the equivalent
of six cups of coffee enables them (the rats) to be one percent more
productive.

Several questions immediately leap to mind.  First, what, exactly, makes
a rat more "productive?"  The mice my son had (until he left the door to
the cage open, and then the cat had them) "produced" only tiny black
pellets.  Did scientists count these pellets and find there were
slightly more of them after six cups of coffee?  If so, they may have
inadvertently discovered a job for which my brother-in-law is
qualified.  As long as counting pellets doesn't involve (a) showing up
for work on time or (b) showing up for work, I can see him rising to the
top of his profession.

Second, what is the "equivalent" of six cups of coffee?  Maybe the
scientists stuck the little rat paws into an electric outlet.  In that
case, heck YES there were more black pellets, probably left there by
rats awaiting their turn at the socket.  Do the People for the Ethical
Treatment of Rodents We Would Otherwise Exterminate know about this?
I'm picturing rats sitting around with tiny cups and saucers, reading
the equivalent of the morning newspaper, watching the equivalent of the
Today show, getting ready for the equivalent of the morning rush hour so
they can get to their little rat offices and start producing one percent
more pellets.  The scientists studying this must feel they are doing the
equivalent of contributing to society.

Finally, if I drink the equivalent of 600 cups of coffee, does this mean
I will be 100% more productive, thus able to stay home and do nothing
while my more productive self goes off to work?  How the heck can I be
more productive if I am in the bathroom all day unloading 600 cups of
coffee?  If Al Gore drank 600 cups of coffee, would he change
expression?

I have a suggestion:  maybe next time the scientists should drink the
coffee themselves, and then they could come up with a better idea for
something to study.  Like, if you gave my brother-in-law the equivalent
of six cups of coffee, would he find a job?

Here's something I wrote after reading one too many of this type of story.

            LIVING IN CAGES LINKED TO CANCER IN LABORATORY RATS

AP--The federal government today released the findings of a four year study
that linked living in cages to increased potential of developing cancer in
laboratory rats.

The study, which cost an estimated $17 Million, was started in 1983 when
all the rats in a laboratory test control group contracted cancer.

Spokesperson John Smith explained: "We were running a test on the possible
link between excess popcorn intake and increased incidence of colon cancer.
The test group consisted of twenty rats who were force fed three quarts
(roughly one and a half times their body weight) of popcorn daily, a
perfectly reasonable amount. The control group consisted of twenty rats who
lived in cages carefully shielded from all known carcinogens. To our
surprise, all twenty control rats developed cancer within six months."

Mr. Smith went on to say: "We had always had some trouble with control rats
contracting cancer. But as long as more of the rats in the test group than
the control group got cancer, we were able to feel pretty good about
condemning whatever we were testing at the time."

Mr Smith was then questioned about the possibility of test results being
invalid if any of the control rats developed cancer. He responded: "Yeah,
we had an scientist at the lab ask that once. We had to let him go though
when we found out he was a member of the Audubon Society; you know,
conflict of interest. He was a real trouble maker, always asking questions
like: 'Wouldn't eating that much popcorn give anyone cancer?' We just
didn't need that kind of a negative influence. The last thing you want in a
research lab is someone asking a lot of fool questions."

When asked if these results would change any previous findings Mr. Smith
replied: "Why yes. This could blow our whole gig. I mean, if it's been the
cages all along, this could mean that things like asbestos, smoking, even
radiation are perfectly harmless!"

Mr Smith continued: "This could change everything! We may be forced to
recall all our previous findings at a cost of millions of dollars. This
says nothing of the possible lawsuits from individuals who contracted
cancer while spending time in prison, or zoo workers forced to spend
extended periods inside the animal's cages."

When asked why the study cost seventeen million dollars, Mr Smith
responded: "Oh, you know how it goes; a little here, a little there.
Besides, do you have any idea how expensive it is to provide food and
living conditions for rats that doesn't expose them to any of the things we
have determined to cause cancer? In fact right now we're in the middle of a
two year study that may link breathing with lung cancer. You think the cost
is bad now, just wait till we are forced to prevent the control rats from
breathing so as not to invalidate the results by having more of the control
rats get cancer than test rats."

When asked if John Smith was his real name, the spokesperson replied: "Huh,
what? You talking to me?"

New from the "Book of the Mouse Club" is this volume describing the uses of

This has often been a problem in the world of developmental biology, where
resources are limited and the animal rights community is always observing

interesting uses which do not necessarily involve science.

*Do you serve a white wine or red with the kabobs?
*Opening a Home Shopping Network of cat toys.
*Testing those unlabelled vials in the medicine cabinet.

                               CATS AND BUGS

Life as a graduate student or other student can get kind of lonely and it
would be nice to be able to go home to a loved one who is excited to see
you.  Having such a bizarre life style can cause problems though as pet
ownership is a big responsibility.  Thus, we at Aliquotes, would like to
make a suggestion which we hope will ease those lonely nights.  The
following is a list of reasons why one might consider having bacteria as
pets as opposed to the more traditional cat.  We hope that this is of
assistance.

1.  A numbers game:  To get more cats (why you would want them is another
question), you need at least two of the opposite sex.  With bacteria, one
will set you up for life.

2.  Sleepless nights:  Unlike cats, bacteria do not go into heat and will
keep you awake all night crying for a little fun.

3.  Low maintenance:  There is no litter box to change and bacteria can be
easily fed by adding more sugar to their medium.

4.  Vacation consideration: Bacteria do not require a neighbour's attention
while you're away.  Just put them in the fridge and they'll stay fresh.
This can also be done with cats but is heavily frown upon.

5.  Life in a vacuum:  While bacteria are also covered with hair (cilia),
but on a microscopic level, they do not feel the need to leave said hairs
all over the place.

6.  Exercise your rights:  You do not need to put your bacteria out for
exercise.  Simply put them in a large flask and shake them for a few
hours.  They are also easier to round up by using the centrifuge.

7.  Death before dishonour:  Bacteria will not bring dead animals into your
house, displaying them proudly at dinner.  At worst a renegade bacterium
will keep you in the bathroom for a few days.

8.  Scratching the surface:  Washing a bacterial pellet does not require a
knowledge of the martial arts and will not leave you with scar tissue.

9.  I can see clearly now:  It is rare when you cannot see the TV screen
because of a bacterium sleeping on top, dangling its legs.  If this is a
problem, it typically implies that you should spend a little more on your
next TV set.

10. Feeling a little flushed:  A bacterium is less likely to clog your
toilet when it dies, causing a $500 plumbing bill.

Here's an old joke that some may appreciate.

Given the above, namely a dry well on the left and a producing well on
the right, the following are the interpretations from some petroleum
professions.

The interpretation of:

a) The Petroleum Engineer:

|--------------|--------------|
|              |              |
|       |      |              |

|              |              |
|--------------|--------------|

b) The Landman:

c) The Geologist:

|              |   '------'   |
|--------------|--------------|

d) The Geophysicist:

|--------------|--------------|
|   .------.   |              |
|  /////|\\\\  |              |

|   '------'   |              |
|--------------|--------------|


Explanation:
The point of my joke, was that everyone had their own interpretation of the
producing well and the dry hole. Also, everyone was right, except for the
Geophysicist.

You see, being a Geophysicist, I can poke fun at my profession. Which is
something that is normally not in character for most Geophysicists. An
ironic double pun as one might observe. But then again, maybe not.

Letter from the Smithsonian:

Paleonanthropology Division
Smithsonian Institute
207 Pennsylvania Avenue
Washington, DC 20078

Dear Sir:

Thank you for your latest submission to the Institute, labeled
"211-D, layer seven, next to the clothesline post.  Hominid Skull."

We have given this specimen a careful and detailed examination, and regret
to inform you that we disagree with your theory that it represents
"conclusive proof of the presence of Early Man in Charleston County two
million years ago."  Rather, it appears that what you have found is the
head of a Barbie doll, of the variety one of our staff, who has small
children, believes to be the "Malibu Barbie."

It is evident that you have given a great deal of thought to the analysis
of this specimen, and you may be quite certain that those of us who are
familiar with your prior work in the field were loathe to come to
contradiction with your findings.  However, we do feel that there are a
number of physical attributes of the specimen which might have tipped you
off to it's modern origin:

1. The material is molded plastic.  Ancient hominid remains are typically
fossilized bone.

2. The cranial capacity of the specimen is approximately 9 cubic
centimeters, well below the threshold of even the earliest identified
proto-hominids.

3. The dentition pattern evident on the "skull" is more consistent with the
common domesticated dog than it is with the "ravenous man-eating Pliocene
clams" you speculate roamed the wetlands during that time.  This latter
finding is certainly one of the most intriguing hypotheses that you have
submitted in your history with this Institution, but the evidence seems to
weigh rather heavily against it.  Without going into too much detail let us
say that:

a. The specimen looks like the head of a Barbie doll that a dog has
chewed on.

b. Clams don't have teeth.

It is with feelings tinged with melancholy that we must deny your request
to have the specimen carbon dated.  This is partially due to the heavy load
our lab must bear in its normal operation, and partly due to carbon
dating's notorious inaccuracy in fossils of recent geologic record.  To the
best of our knowledge, no Barbie dolls were produced prior to 1956 AD, and
carbon dating is likely to produce wildly inaccurate results.

Sadly, we must also deny your request that we approach the National Science
Foundation's Phylogeny Department with the concept of assigning your
specimen the scientific name "Australopithecus spiff-arino."  Speaking
personally, I, for one, fought tenaciously for the acceptance of your
proposed taxonomy, but was ultimately voted-down because the species name
you selected was hyphenated, and did not really sound like it might be
Latin.

However, we gladly accept your generous donation of the fascinating
specimen to the museum.  While it is undoubtedly not a hominid fossil, it
is, nonetheless, yet another riveting example of the great body of work you
seem to accumulate here so effortlessly.  You should know that our Director
has reserved a special shelf in his own office for the display of the
specimens you have previously submitted to the Institution, and the entire
staff speculates daily on what you will happen upon next in your digs at
the site you have discovered in your back yard.

We eagerly anticipate your trip to our nation's capital that you proposed
in your last letter, and several of us are pressing the Director to pay for
it.  We are particularly interested in hearing you expand on your theories
surrounding the "trans-positating fillifitation of ferrous ions in a
structural matrix" that makes the excellent juvenile Tyrannosaurus Rex
femur you recently discovered take on the deceptive appearance of a rusty
3/8 inch Sears Craftsman automotive crescent wrench.

Yours in Science,
Harvey Rowe
Curator, Antiquities

In England, the "n" is only sometimes capitalized, such as in North Pole,
North Korea, the Northeast of England, but not in "I walked three miles
north" and similarly for the other directions: east, south and west. Your
rule may be what is used in America, but it is certainly not a rule of
English.

In any event, what about the following possibilities?

The man kills a polar bear, goes to the South Pole, builds a house, dumps
the polar bear outside, goes inside, looks out the window and sees a white
bear- the very one he killed or indeed another one that someone else put
there. It need not be a polar bear either. It could be a different type of
bear, for example a grizzly bear, which he painted white or tippexed white
or in some other way made white and then did as I suggested above with the
polar bear. (By this I mean, kill it and place it outside his house.)
Alternatively, he may have just transported a live white bear there. This
would probably require a tranquilizer of some sort to sedate the bear
during transportation and would be more dangerous in the event that he
wished to leave the house. On the plus side, he could take supplies and
have a fresh supply of meat from the bear at a later date whereas, if it
were already dead, he would either have to eat it straight away or let it
go to waste. Having written that, I suppose he could freeze it quite easily
instead.
This may sound far-fetched but it is no more so than building a house the
roof of which covers nearly all of the planet- which is also a valid
solution of course (I am not trying to say otherwise).  More reasonably, it
could have been a white teddy bear, especially if he had small children
with him or a white welcome mat for visitors (see below) or a white
hole-punch. There are still other possibilities which you can come up with
from the source referenced below and which I might myself quote, were it
not for the fact that my email account that has the OED on it crashed in
the middle of writing this- leading to my having to post this from
Netscape- and thus I don't have access to it (short of searching the web
for long periods of time with the result that I would be late for "Mr. Nice
Guy").

'Greenwich Mean Time' Arrested
His 'Mean' Reign of Terror Ends

LONDON: This Wednesday, GMT's fascist reign of terror was finally put to
rest as officials placed it under arrest for
malicious conduct.

Greenwich 'Mean' Time, the bad-boy of time zones and the standard for
world timekeeping, has finally been dethroned.  Executives of the London
Time Council have replaced GMT with DKAT, Dublin Kindly Agreeable Time,
long the quiet and polite secretary to Greenwich Mean Time.

The new changes will affect world time standards in the following ways
(some slipped in as last minute conveniences by Time Legislators):

Time Magazine will no longer be able to use the "Time" trademark. The
Council has recommended that they use the public domain "Division Of
Geologic Chronology Magazine", "Duration Magazine", or "Spaceless
Continuum Of Ordered Events Magazine".

The flow of time has been normalized; time will no longer fly when
you're having fun, nor will the last fifteen minutes of class appear to
take hours.

Milk will now immediately spoil when crossing the International Date
Line on the day before its expiration date. This was previously abused
by several black market milk dealers, who used this anomaly to keep milk
fresh far past its expiration.

Due to the massive unpopularity of the setting-clocks-forward phase of
Daylight Savings Time, the new standard mandates that the world set its
clocks backward in both October and April, affording an extra hour of
sleep twice a year.

Father Time commented, "These changes are definitely for the best.
Frankly, I was sick of Greenwich's 'mean' time, and it's about.. er..
time that we instituted a more amicable version."

Time Magazine could not be reached for comment.

                           Abstract


The Googly Plateau of King Harry XXV Land is a metaclastic succession of
Archaean, Proterozoic and Phaneritic meta-amphibolite metafacies
intruded in some places by tonalite-trodnjemite-basanite-microdiorite
tuffs in part deformed and conformed probably during the Siluro-Permian
Maggie Tabberer Orogeny and bounded on many sides by steeply dipping,
flat-lying reverse thrust faults. The basement rock is Martian and
probably pre-dates the solar system. In particular, the Queen Kylie
Glacier Member of the Devils Arse Formation is a phanerolithic band of
rock contorted and distorted in Northwest, Northeast, Southwest and
Southeast dipping anticlinoria. It is a quartz-nepheline diamictite
containing abundant clasts of pyroxene-rich limestone with ripple-marks,
wormholes and vesicles. It is probably definitely stylonodular. The
authors imagine that these highly terrigenous phenocrysts were derived
from lowlands in the North, South, East and West when they were exposed
to a primary oxygen ratio. Isotopic dating indicates that these
metaclastics are really, really old. Probably the uplift was initiated
in the Recent Epoch when plates were colliding all over the shop and
there were more Benioff zones than Ive had hot dinners.

HIGH-RESOLUTION, HIGH-PRECISION, HIGH-ACCURACY, HIGH-SENSITIVITY
ANALYTICAL DATA FROM THE ____________ COMPLEX: IMPLICATIONS FOR RESOURCE
ASSESSMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION
P.P. Em, Science Consultancy Institute of the South Pacific.

While on vacation, one of the laboratory staff obtained a rock sample
from the side of a road somewhere near ________________ . The sample was
sawn, trimmed, split, disaggregated, sieved, pulverised, mixed with
concentrated hydrochloric, hydrofluoric, sulphuric, nitric, acetic and
citric acids, beaten until well-blended, placed in a round glass dish
and baked in an oven at 350deg F for one hour. Three picograms of sample
were analysed by state-of-the-art SEM, TEM, XRD, XRF, EPMA, AAS, PIXE,
XAFS, AMS, LA-ICP-MS, TIMS, SIMS and SHRIMP methods. All results were
filtered for anomalies and were then smoothed, corrected, reduced,
double-normalised and plotted on small diagrams with 0.5 standard
deviation error bars. Detailed interpretation of LLDs as well as HFSE,
LILE, PGE and REE concentrations, isotopic ratios, fractionation
factors, discordia trajectories, spidergams and colour inkjet plots
viewed through 3D glasses indicate that the sample is unlikely to
represent degassed unremelted homogenised depleted MORB-like Phanerozoic
subcontinental upper mantle, at least at the 34% confidence level.
Factors which could contribute to the observed differences between this
sample and the previous 3pg of material analysed by this well-equipped
world-class analytical facility are considered.

INTERNATIONAL MULTIDISCIPLINARY GEOPHYSICAL PROFILING OF THE SHALLOW AND
DEEP LITHOSPHERE NEAR _____________ : IMPLICATIONS FOR HAZARD ANALYSIS
AND GONDWANA EVOLUTION
T. Emblor, Science Consultancy Institute of the South Pacific.

Mountain ranges are sometimes formed by compression or transpression at
plate margins. Specific examination of the utilisation of different
geophysical methods in common use around the world led to the conducting
of a "campaign-style" detailed, long baseline geophysical survey
experiment across _______________ in order to improve understanding of
the area. A supplemental series of experiments was conducted in an
attempt to assess the precision of measurable components. These
secondary experiments showed that geophysical processes can be estimated
to a high degree of precision. Accordingly, spatial parameters were
combined to make a new multi-terabyte database on a SUN workstation.
Although the Principal Investigators failed to agree on a snappy acronym
for the experiment, the main survey did reveal the presence of
lithospheric heterogeneity and/or anisotropy in the crust beneath the
area. Changes in the physical properties of the host rocks and/or
presence of fluids are favoured to account for changes in observed
components. Data are consistent with previously identified broad scale
tectonic models. Technical limitations, imposed by external factors,
were also identified during the main and secondary experiments.

GEOLOGY OF A REMOTE AND RUGGED AREA NEAR _____________ : IMPLICATIONS
FOR HAZARD ANALYSIS AND RESOURCE ASSESSMENT
Hal Fanglegraben, Science Consultancy Institute of the South Pacific.

During the course of a helicopter-supported field study, a previously
unmapped rock unit was found to outcrop over a large area. The upper
contact of the unit is hidden by a deeply-crevassed ice plateau, and the
lower contact is obscured by alluvium deposited by swollen rivers
impassable even by 4WD vehicle. Although a number of lithological
subdivisions can be made, different degrees of disruption are observed
across the unit and the recognition of at least seven phases of
deformation means that total thickness is poorly known. Detailed studies
of the unit together with analyses of its constituents provide the basis
for an assessment of its characteristics. Composition is variable, but
is generally similar to nearby bodies with which the unit is correlated.
Particular reference is made to possible, but enigmatic,
interrelationships between tectonic activity, mineralisation and slope
angle. More data are needed to extend this reconnaissance study, thus
enabling a better picture of regional relationships to be determined.

ISN'T the orientation the room was in the last time you were there.  Then
tell them that it is a vicious plot of the geology department to use
tectonic forces to move all to rooms on campus so that everyone will
sucumb to their devious plans to rule the Earth...etc...etc...

---  Bring a stuffed animal that looks really bizarre.  Mid-way through
the exam, walk up to the front like you're in show-n-tell and tell the
class in a cute 5 year old voice about your buddy, "Isogyer."

---  Bring a soft black rock (carbonates, coal, ...etc...etc...)
and write the entire exam with it.

---  Lay on the floor while doing the exam.  When the professor asks what
the heck are you doing, just tell the prof that you're getting closer to
mother Earth so that you'll do better.

---  For a palentology exam, bring bones and beat on the table you are
sitting at while singing "Roll the Bones" by Rush.

---  For an Environmental Studies class walk into the room with an NRA
shirt and begin to inform everybody that they're a bunch of
envronmentalist wackos.

---  Use a petrographic microscope to look at the exam.

---  Bring pulverized sulfur, be creative.

---  Come to the exam late and before you sit down at a desk strike it
with a pick.  Carefully listen to the tone and pretend it isn't right.
Don't sit down until you've tried this with every empty desk at least 3
times each.  After you finally find a place to sit, get up every fifteen
minutes and do it all over again and find another place to sit.

---  When you get the exam, give it back to the professor and tell him to
save the trees.

---  Pull out a decent sized chunk of gypsum and begin to gnaw on it.
Explain that it makes for a great aphrodisiac.

---  Hide small farm animals in specimine drawers.

---  If the test involves topographic maps, put Garfield stickers all over
it...If it's a map of Michigan, put an Elvis stamp on Kalamazoo.

---  Comment on how sexy the professor would look with a pick hanging from
their belt.

---  Run into the room screaming, "OH NO!  IT'S THE GLACIERS!  THEY'RE
COMMING BACK AND THEY'RE PISSED!"

---  Bring a calculator to an essay exam.  Pretend to use it often.

---  Do an imitation of soil creep.  Be sure to include sound effects.

---  Pretend to be blind and act like the only way you can see is by
looking through biotite flakes.

---  Act as though one of the crystals in the room is sucking the life
force out of you.  Just like superman and kryptonite.

---  Become a lithophagic organism.

                          The Tao of Forecasting

Something mysterious is formed, born in the silent void. Waiting alone and
unmoving, it is at once still and yet in constant motion. It is the source
of all forecasting knowledge. It has no name, so we call it the Tao.

1 If the chart is seen, the surface form is seen. 
If the Tao is seen, then the underlying form is seen. 
Then there is truly harmony. 

2 The foolish forecaster is told about Tao and laughs at it. 
The average forecaster is told about Tao and searches for it. 
The wise forecaster is told about Tao and follows it. 

3 A novice asked the Master Forecaster: "Sometimes my forecast verifies,
and other times it doesn't. I have followed the model guidance, yet I am
totally baffled. What is the reason for this?"
The Master replied: "You are confused because you do not understand
Tao. Only a fool expects rational behavior from the atmosphere. Why do you
expect this from a machine that humans have constructed? Computers simulate
determinism; yet Tao arises from chaos. Therefore, you must contemplate Tao
before you receive Enlightenment."
"But how will I know when I have received Enlightenment?" asked the novice.
"Your forecasts will be perfect," replied the Master. 

4 A great storm was bearing down on the village. Pompous Forecaster was
intently studying the radar with Novice, while the Master Forecaster was
meditating in his chair.
Said Pompous Forecaster, "Come over here and see this radar image. Notice
the hook shape on this storm. Notice the mid-level mesocyclone
alert. Notice the appearance of high VIL values. Surely there will be a
tornado. We should take cover now."
The Master Forecaster said. "There will be no tornado." He then resumed
meditating.
Pompous Forecaster was stunned. "You fool! The facts are right here on the
screen. Do you not see?"
The Master ignored him. 
It came to pass that the storm moved away, with no tornado. The Novice
confronted the Master in private. "Please enlighten me, Great Master. How
did you know there would be no tornado?"
"Do you see the window over there? Look through it, Novice, and there you
will find Tao."


5 There once was a Master Forecaster who consulted computer models in
detail. Often he shook his head mightily and cried out in disgust. Often he
tapped the chart in silent approval.
The Novice, seeking to imitate him, also began to consult computer models,
either crying out or tapping the chart in approval.
When Novice asked the Master to evaluate his progress, the Master
criticized him: "What is appropriate for the Master is not appropriate for
the novice. You must understand Tao before transcending beyond the real
atmosphere."

6 Taking a break from his forecast, the Student Forecaster said: "Master,
what is Enlightenment?"
Said Master Forecaster: "Enlightenment is complete attention on reality
itself, instead of focusing on our intellectual and emotional reactions to
reality. Reality is the ever-changing, ever-growing, indefinable something
known as the atmosphere."

The Student held up the 500 millibar chart: "But how does that help me with this?" 
The Master said: "Ignorance is studying the chart. Enlightenment is studying the atmosphere on the chart." 
Feeling the humid breeze which wafted through the open door of the forecast office, Student and Master meditated on this. 

7 Said the Student: "Show me the way to Enlightenment." 

The Master dug through a pile of weather charts and pulled out a satellite
photo. "Do you see this image?"
"Yes." 
"Enter here." 

8 "All this Enlightenment stuff is nonsense," said the Bureaucrat. 
"You are perfectly correct," responded the Master Forecaster. "But this is
a teaching I normally reserve for only my most advanced students."

9 Master and Student stood outside the forecast office, admiring a
beautiful mammatus display underneath a thunderstorm anvil.
Said Student: "Is there anything more miraculous than the wonders of nature?" 
Said Master: "Yes. Your appreciation of those wonders." 

10 Said the Master: "When Student depends on numerical models, it is like
chasing his own shadow. It makes Student healthy, fit, and enthusiastic,
yet all the time he is running away from the sun."

11 A renowned Professor once visited the Master to learn about
Enlightenment. "Let us see the weather patterns," said the Professor.
The Master sat at his weather analysis computer, began with a blank weather
chart, and pulled up hundreds of transparent overlays, turning the map into
a chaotic sea of green. The Professor cried for him to clear the screen and
start again.
Said the Master: "The screen is full of weather maps and can hold no
more. In the same way your mind is full of ideas and there is no room for
my teachings, unless you empty it."

12 The Master's student was wrestling with a difficult weather
forecast. Finally he stood up and said: "Master, surely Tao is not to be
found in this ETA forecast. Yet it says this trough will open and lift
northeastward. I have found Tao in my analysis, but how may I find Tao
within my forecast if harmony within the ETA forecast is not known?"
The Master replied: "Student, you have answered your own question. You are
looking for harmony within the pieces but not for harmony between the
whole."
Suddenly the student was enlightened. 

13 Bureaucrat went to the Master Forecaster and showed him the requirements
to forecast for the Superbowl.
He asked the Master: "How long will it take to produce a forecast if I
assign five forecasters to the task?"
"It will take three hours," said the Master promptly. 
"But we need a more timely forecast! How long will it take if I assign ten forecasters to it?" 
The Master Forecaster frowned. "In that case, it will take two days." 
"And what if I assign a hundred forecasters to it?" 
The Master Forecaster shrugged. "Then the forecast will never be completed." 

14 The Master and Novice were sitting on a rock in the park. Energized by
the sun, the Novice said: "Master, enlighten me so that I may find harmony
in my forecasts."
The Master pointed. "Look. Do you see that old man? A friend told me that
he would climb Mount Xianjing tomorrow and stay up on the summit all night,
drinking wine and carousing. Do you agree he will do this tomorrow?"
Said the Novice: "I do not know. True, I could accept your friend's
opinion, but I would want to go over right now and talk to this man, ask
him questions, and understand him thoroughly before I could answer for
certain."
"You have been enlightened," said the Master. 

15 Said the Master Forecaster: 
"A well-developed analysis is its own Heaven; 
A poorly-developed forecast is its own Hell." 

16 Much to the dismay of the Master, the forecasters in the weather office
eagerly accepted the duty to devise an immediate forecast for the Emperor's
anniversary ceremony, ten days away. Many of the forecasters argued to use
the MRF, while others insisted that the ECMWF should be followed.
In a flash of insight, the student blurted, "Let us combine both models!" 
The Master suddenly came forth and reprimanded the student with a
stick. "Novice! Enough nonsense. Come with me and let us meditate."
The two went outside into the rock garden. The Master said, "Let us sit
over here, where we cannot possibly be bothered by the blacksmith's smoke."
The two went to a corner of the garden and sat in silence, relaxing their
minds and staring into the sky, contemplating its great mysteries.
After much time had passed, a small cloud of smoke from the blacksmith's
fire wafted over and choked both Master and student. Suddenly the student
was enlightened.

17 The Master was explaining the nature of Tao to one of his novices. 
"The Tao is embodied in all meteorology -- regardless of how insignificant," said the Master. 
"Is the Tao in a stratocumulus cloud?" asked the novice. 
"It is," came the reply. 
"Is the Tao in a SKEW-T diagram?" asked the novice. 
"It is even in a SKEW-T diagram," said the Master. 
"Is the Tao in a numerical forecast model?" asked the novice. 
The Master gently cleared his throat and stood up. "The lesson is over for today." 

18 Prince Li's forecaster was analyzing a map. His pencil danced upon the
weather map. His forecasts had always been faultless.
"I am astonished!" the Prince exclaimed. "Your technique is faultless!"
"Technique?" said the Master, turning from his map. "What I follow is Tao
-- beyond all techniques! When I first began to forecast, I would see
before me the atmosphere on separate charts. After three years, I no longer
saw this. Instead, I saw the atmosphere blended together from all of the
different charts, combined in three dimensions within my mind. Now I see
nothing. My whole being exists in a formless void. My senses are idle. My
spirit, free to work without a plan, follows its own instinct while I put
pencil to paper and sift through the charts. In short, my forecast produces
itself. True, sometimes there are difficult problems. I see them coming, I
slow down, I watch silently. Then I focus, use all of the tools available
to me, and the difficulties vanish like puffs of idle smoke. I then
complete the forecast. I sit still and let the joy of the work fill my
being. I close my eyes for a moment and then go home."
Prince Li said, "If only all of my forecasters were as wise!" 

19 The Novice held up a chart for the Master. He said, "This ETA chart
shows that the CAPE over here will be quite large, but I do not understand
this, because the dryline should mix rapidly eastward."
The Master disappeared and came back with a glass of iced tea for the
Novice. "This is to help you think."
The Novice bowed deeply, took the tea, and sipped it. He looked at it,
thought, and sipped it again. He said, "Master, did you sweeten my drink
with Equal?"
"Ah, Student. Your senses tell you that it is not sugar! Is it not good?" 
"Yes, Master, it is good. It is very much like sugar and sweetens my drink nicely." 
"And is it a perfect substitute for sugar?" 
The Novice looked at his chart and suddenly was enlightened. 

20 A well-used door needs no oil on its hinges. 
These are the truths of the Tao of Forecasting. 

21 When a forecaster computes stability indices, he sees the sounding
within man-made constructs.
Truly, this is not the Tao of Forecasting. 
When a forecaster studies the sounding, he sees the underlying form. 
Truly, this is the Tao of Forecasting. 

22 Computer met Capitalist on the road to Changtse. Computer said: "You are
Yin and I am Yang. Together we will find Tao, redefine the science of
forecasting, and obtain vast sums of funding."  And so they set forth
together, thinking to conquer the world.  Presently, they met Hand Plotted
Chart, who was dressed in tattered rags and hobbled along propped on a
thorny stick. Hand Plotted Chart said to them: "I have seen Tao, and it
lies beyond Yin and Yang. It is silent and still as a pool of water. It
does not seek money; therefore nobody knows its presence. It does not seek
to teach, for those only those who desire it can find it. It does not seek
enlightenment, for it is complete within itself. It exists beyond space and
time."  Computer and Capitalist, ashamed, returned to their homes.

MPE________________________________________________________________________
jwest@jwest.ecen.okstate.edu:
A mathematician, a physicist, and an engineer were all given a red rubber
ball and told to find the volume. The mathematician carefully measured
the diameter and evaluated a triple integral.  The physicist filled a
beaker with water, put the ball in the water, and measured the total
displacement. The engineer looked up the model and serial numbers in
his red-rubber-ball table.

If it was my company:  The engineer tried to look up the model and serial
numbers, couldn't find them, so told his manager that it's just not going
to work.

So a mathematician, an engineer, and a physicist are out hunting
together.  They spy a deer(*) in the woods.

The physicist calculates the velocity of the deer and the effect of
gravity on the bullet, aims his rifle and fires.  Alas, he misses; the
bullet passes three feet behind the deer.  The deer bolts some yards,
but comes to a halt, still within sight of the trio.

"Shame you missed," comments the engineer, "but of course with an
ordinary gun, one would expect that."  He then levels his special
deer-hunting gun, which he rigged together from an ordinary rifle, a
sextant, a compass, a barometer, and a bunch of flashing lights which
don't do anything but impress onlookers, and fires.  Alas, his bullet
passes three feet in front of the deer, who by this time wises up and
vanishes for good.

"Well," says the physicist, "your contraption didn't get it either."

"What do you mean?" pipes up the mathematician.  "Between the two of
you, that was a perfect shot!"

(*) How they knew it was a deer:

The physicist observed that it behaved in a deer-like manner, so it
must be a deer.

The mathematician asked the physicist what it was, thereby reducing it
to a previously solved problem.

The engineer was in the woods to hunt deer, therefore it was a deer.

A mathematician and a physicist agree to a psychological experiment.
The mathematician is put in a chair in a large empty room and a
beautiful naked woman is placed on a bed at the other end of the room.
The psychologist explains, "You are to remain in your chair.  Every
five minutes, I will move your chair to a position halfway between its
current location and the woman on the bed."  The mathematician looks
at the psychologist in disgust.  "What? I'm not going to go through
this.  You know I'll never reach the bed!"  And he gets up and storms
out.  The psychologist makes a note on his clipboard and ushers the
physicist in.  He explains the situation, and the physicist's eyes
light up and he starts drooling.  The psychologist is a bit confused.
"Don't you realize that you'll never reach her?"  The physicist smiles
and replied, "Of course!  But I'll get close enough for all practical
purposes!"

A businessman needed to employ a quantitative type person.
He wasn't sure if he should get a mathematician, an engineer,
or an applied mathematician.  As it happened, all the
applicants were male.  The businessman devised a test.
The mathematician came first.  Miss How, the administrative
assistant took him into the hall.  At the end of the hall,
lounging on a couch, was a beautiful woman.  Miss How said,
"You may only go half the distance at a time.  When you
reach the end, you may kiss our model."
The mathematician explained how he would never get there in
a finite number of iterations and politely excused himself.
Then came the engineer.  He quickly bounded halfway down the
hall, then halfway again, and so on.  Soon he declared he was
well within accepted error tolerance and grabbed the beautiful
woman and kissed her.
Finally it was the applied mathematician's turn.  Miss How
explained the rules.  The applied mathematician listened
politely, then grabbed Miss How and gave her a big smooch.
"What was that about?" she cried.
"Well, you see I'm an applied mathematician.  If I can't
solve the problem, I change it!"

Suddenly the jeep stops and they're left sitting there wondering what
happened..

The Eng student pipes up,
 " must be the fan belt thats broken..the engine has overheated...so we'll just
have to wait till it cools down, bodge the fan belt and we'll be fine."

The meterology replies,
"naw, it's not that...its just the ambient heat in this place. It's not
allowing the engine to breath correctly...we just have to wait till night

"Aha," says the philosopher, "I see that Scottish sheep are black."

"Hmm," says the physicist, "You mean that some Scottish sheep are
black."

"No," says the mathematician, "All we know is that there is at least
one sheep in Scotland, and that at least one side of that one sheep is
black!"

"Oh, no!" shouts the computer scientist, "A special case!"

one black to three hundred and seventeen white" replied Holmes.

There were two men trying to decide what to do for a living.  They
went to see a counselor, and he decided that they had good problem
solving skills.

He tried a test to narrow the area of specialty.  He put each man in a
room with a stove, a table, and a pot of water on the table.  He said
"Boil the water".  Both men moved the pot from the table to the stove
and turned on the burner to boil the water.  Next, he put them into a
room with a stove, a table, and a pot of water on the floor.  Again,
he said "Boil the water".  The first man put the pot on the stove and
turned on the burner.  The counselor told him to be an Engineer,

him to be a mathematician because he reduced the problem to a

One said, ``It was a mechanical engineer.  Just look at all the joints.''

Another said, ``No, it was an electrical engineer.  The nervous system has
many thousands of electrical connections.''

The last said, ``Actually it was a civil engineer.  Who else would run a

An engineer, a physicist, and a mathematician are shown a pasture
with a herd of sheep, and told to put them inside the smallest
possible amount of fence. The engineer is first.  He herds the sheep
into a circle and then puts the fence around them, declaring, "A
circle will use the least fence for a given area, so this is the
best solution." The physicist is next. She creates a circular fence of
infinite radius around the sheep, and then draws the fence tight around
the herd, declaring, "This will give the smallest circular fence around
the herd." The mathematician is last. After giving the problem a little
thought, he puts a small fence around himself and then declares, "I
define myself to be on the outside!"

proclaimed that he had the most efficient design.  The physicist made
a long, straight line and proclaimed 'We can assume the length is
infinite...' and pointed out that fencing off half of the Earth was
certainly a more efficient way to do it.  The Mathematician just
laughed at them.  He built a tiny fence around himself and said 'I

Four men were sitting one day discussing how smart their dog's were.
The first man was an Engineer, who said his dog could do math.  His dog
was named T-Square, and he told him to get some paper and draw a square,
a circle, and a triangle, which the dog did with no sweat.

The Accountant said that his dog was better.  His dog, Slide Rule, was
told to fetch a dozen cookies, bring them back, and divide them into
piles of 3, which Slide Rule did with no problem.

The Chemist said his dog was smarter, his dog named Measure, was told to
get a quart of milk, and pour 7 ounces into a 10 ounce glass.  The dog
did this with no trouble at all, and all three men agreed that their
dog's were equally smart.

Then they turned to the Union Member and asked, what can your dog do?
The Union Member called his dog, who was named Coffee Break, and said,
"Show the fellows what you can do".

Coffee Break went over and ate the cookies, drank the milk, shit on the
paper, fucked the other dogs, and claimed he injured his back while
doing so, filed a grievence report for unsafe working conditions, put in
for Workmens Compensation, and left for home on sick leave.

A physicist, an engineer and a mathematician make their first parachute
jump.  Before the jump the instructor explains exactly what they must do:
Jump out of the plane, count until three and pull the line.

The physicist jumps.  For him counting till three is too unexact and too
primitive.  Instead, he calculates out of his height, angle and velocity
the exact moment he should pull the line for a soft landing and arrives
optimally.

The engineer is a practical man and thinks calling to three is too
unreliable and therefore dangerous...   He jumps and pulls the line
immediately.  He takes a bit longer than the physicist but he lands
safely.

Both see jump the mathematician jump out of the plane.  He falls  ... and
falls ... and falls ...
No parachute opens and finally he falls on the ground.  Fortunately, he
lands in a haystack.  The physicist and engineer walk alarmed to the

The USDA once wanted to make cows produce milk faster, to improve the
dairy industry.

So, they decided to consult the foremost biologists and recombinant
DNA technicians to build them a better cow.  They assembled this team
of great scientists, and gave them unlimited funding.  They requested
rare chemicals, weird bacteria, tons of quarantine equipment, there
was a horrible typhus epidemic they started by accident, and, 2 years
later, they came back with the "new, improved cow."  It had a milk
production improvement of 2% over the original.

They then tried with the greatest Nobel Prize winning chemists around.
They worked for six months, and, after requisitioning tons of chemical
equipment, and poisoning half the small town in Colorado where they
were working with a toxic cloud from one of their experiments, they
got a 5% improvement in milk output.

The physicists tried for a year, and, after ten thousand cows were
subjected to radiation therapy, they got a 1% improvement in output.

Finally, in desperation, they turned to the mathematicians.  The
foremost mathematician of his time offered to help them with the
problem.  Upon hearing the problem, he told the delegation that they
could come back in the morning and he would have solved the problem.
In the morning, they came back, and he handed them a piece of paper
with the computations for the new, 300% improved milk cow.

The plans began:

racehorse, but it would take 200 years and $100 billion. The statisticians
reported next. They said that they could predict the outcome of any race,
at a cost of $100 million per race, and they would only be right 10% of the
time. Finally, the physicists reported that they could also predict the

A group of scientists were doing an investigation into problem-solving
techniques, and constructed an experiment involving a physicist, an
engineer, and a mathematician.

The experimental apparatus consisted of a water spigot and two identical
pails, one of which was fastened to the ground ten feet from the spigot.

Each of the subjects was given the second pail, empty, and told to fill the
pail on the ground.

The physicist was the first subject:  he carried his pail to the spigot,
filled it there, carried it full of water to the pail on the ground, and
poured the water into it.  Standing back, he declared, "There: I have
solved the problem."

The engineer and the mathematician each approached the problem similarly.
Upon finishing, the engineer noted that the solution was exact, since the
volumes of the pails were equal.  The mathematician merely noted that he
had proven that a solution exists.

Now, the experimenters altered the parameters of the task a bit:  the pail
on the ground was still empty, but the subjects were presented with a pail
that was already half-filled with water.

The physicist immediately carried his pail over to the one on the ground,
emptied the water into it, went back to the spigot, *filled* the pail, and
finally emptied the entire contents into the pail on the ground,
overflowing it and spilling some of the water.  Upon finishing, he
commented that the problem should have been better stated.

The engineer, in turn, thought for some time before going into action.  He
then took his half-filled pail to the spigot, filled it to the brim, and
filled the pail on the ground from it.  Again he noted that the problem had
an exact solution, which of course he had found.

The mathematician thought for a long time before stirring.  At last he
stood up, emptied his pail onto the ground, and declared, "The problem has
been reduced to one already solved."

Inside the cabin was a wood-burning stove, but it was set up on bricks

The next morning, the friends meet at the bottom of the Eiffel Tower.

Once upon a time, in a kingdom not far from here, a king summoned two
of his advisors for a test. He showed them both a shiny metal box with
two slots in the top, a control knob, and a lever. "What do you think
this is?"

One advisor, an engineer, answered first. "It is a toaster," he said.
The king asked, "How would you design an embedded computer for it?"
The engineer replied, "Using a four-bit microcontroller, I would write
a simple program that reads the darkness knob and quantizes its
position to one of 16 shades of darkness, from snow white to coal
black. The program would use that darkness level as the index to a
16-element table of initial timer values. Then it would turn on the
heating elements and start the timer with the initial value selected
from the table. At the end of the time delay, it would turn off the
heat and pop up the toast. Come back next week, and I'll show you a
working prototype."

The second advisor, a computer scientist, immediately recognized the
danger of such short-sighted thinking. He said, "Toasters don't just
turn bread into toast, they are also used to warm frozen waffles. What
you see before you is really a breakfast food cooker. As the subjects
of your kingdom become more sophisticated, they will demand more
capabilities. They will need a breakfast food cooker that can also
cook sausage, fry bacon, and make scrambled eggs. A toaster that only
makes toast will soon be obsolete. If we don't look to the future, we
will have to completely redesign the toaster in just a few years."

"With this in mind, we can formulate a more intelligent solution to
the problem. First, create a class of breakfast foods. Specialize this
class into subclasses: grains, pork, and poultry. The specialization
process should be repeated with grains divided into toast, muffins,
pancakes, and waffles; pork divided into sausage, links, and bacon;
and poultry divided into scrambled eggs, hard- boiled eggs, poached
eggs, fried eggs, and various omelet classes."

"The ham and cheese omelet class is worth special attention because it
must inherit characteristics from the pork, dairy, and poultry
classes. Thus, we see that the problem cannot be properly solved
without multiple inheritance. At run time, the program must create the
proper object and send a message to the object that says, 'Cook
yourself.' The semantics of this message depend, of course, on the
kind of object, so they have a different meaning to a piece of toast
than to scrambled eggs."

"Reviewing the process so far, we see that the analysis phase has
revealed that the primary requirement is to cook any kind of breakfast
food. In the design phase, we have discovered some derived
requirements. Specifically, we need an object-oriented language with
multiple inheritance. Of course, users don't want the eggs to get cold
while the bacon is frying, so concurrent processing is required, too."

"We must not forget the user interface. The lever that lowers the food
lacks versatility, and the darkness knob is confusing. Users won't buy
the product unless it has a user-friendly, graphical interface. When
the breakfast cooker is plugged in, users should see a cowboy boot on
the screen. Users click on it, and the message 'Booting UNIX v.8.3'
appears on the screen. (UNIX 8.3 should be out by the time the product
gets to the market.) Users can pull down a menu and click on the foods
they want to cook."

"Having made the wise decision of specifying the software first in the
design phase, all that remains is to pick an adequate hardware
platform for the implementation phase. An Intel 80386 with 8MB of
memory, a 30MB hard disk, and a VGA monitor should be sufficient. If
you select a multitasking, object oriented language that supports
multiple inheritance and has a built-in GUI, writing the program will
be a snap. (Imagine the difficulty we would have had if we had
foolishly allowed a hardware-first design strategy to lock us into a
four-bit microcontroller!)."

The king wisely had the computer scientist beheaded, and they all
lived happily ever after.

A mathematician and a physicist are trying to measure the height of a
flag pole using a long tape measure.  The mathematician takes the tape
measure, walks up to the flag pole, and begins to shinny up the pole.  A
short way up, he slips and falls down.

The physicist notices a ladder lying nearby in the bushes.  He leans the
ladder against the pole, but it reaches only half way up.  He climbs the
ladder and tries to shinny up from there, but he also slips and falls.

While they sit near the pole scratching their heads, an engineer
walks by, so the mathematician and the physicist tell him their problem.
The engineer notices a crank at the base of the flag pole.  He turns the
crank, and the flag pole tilts over until it lies on the ground.  The
engineer stretches out the tape measure, cranks the pole back up, and
tells the mathematician and the physicist: 'It is 15 meters.'

As the engineer walks off into the distance, the mathematician looks at
the physicist and says: 'Isn't that just like an engineer?  You ask him
for the height, and he gives you the length.'

BUT SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE THE STORY GOES LIKE THIS:
A team of engineers were required to measure the height of a flag
pole. They only had a measuring tape, and were getting quite
frustrated trying to keep the tape along the pole.  It kept falling
down, etc.

A mathematician comes along, finds out their problem, and proceeds to
remove the pole from the ground and measure it easily.

When he leaves, one engineer says to the other:  "Just like a
mathematician!  We need to know the height, and he gives us the
length!"

In an effort to determine the department which produces the most
intelligent graduates, a university president threw down a challenge to the
deans of the schools of science, engineering, and business.  He asked each
to send him their brightest student from the current graduating class to
compete in solving a simple problem.

The next day, three students showed up at the university president's
office.  He explained the problem as follows:

"I want you to determine the height of the university's newest residence
tower.  I am giving each of you only three tools to work with: a stop
watch, a ruler and a ball of string.  You are each to devise your own
solution to the problem and report back here by the end of the day.
Whoever has the most accurate answer wins."

The three students set off to the new residence tower.  The science manor
went immediately to the roof of the building and dropped the ruler over the
side, carefully timing its descent with the stop watch.  Factoring in the
aerodynamic properties of the ruler, the science major calculated the
height of the building within six inches.

Next the engineering major, still panting from running up all the stairs to
the roof, took his turn.  He tied the stop watch onto the end of the ball
of string and gently lowered it until it just touched the ground.  Reeling
the string back up, he measured it carefully with the ruler, making
adjustments for its elasticity under the weight of the stop watch, and
calculated the height of the building within two inches.

At that point, the science major turns to the engineering major and asks,
"What happened to the kid from the business school?  I thought he was right
behind us."

They head back down to the building lobby and there, sitting comfortably in
an upholstered chair, is the business major.

"So, what are you going to do?" asks the science major.

"Oh, I'm done," says the business major, unfolding a piece of paper on
which is written the height of the building expressed to the last
one-eighth inch.

"How did you do that?" asks the engineering major.

"Simple," replies the student from the business school.  "While you guys
were screwing around up on the roof, I went down to the basement and found
the building superintendant.  I told him I'd give him a nice stop watch if
he'd let me look through the architectural plans for the building."

An engineer, a physicist and a mathematician find themselves in an
anecdote, indeed an anecdote quite similar to many that you have no
doubt already heard.  After some observations and rough calculations
the engineer realizes the situation and starts laughing.  A few
minutes later the physicist understands too and chuckles to himself
happily as he now has enough experimental evidence to publish a paper.

This leaves the mathematician somewhat perplexed, as he had observed
right away that he was the subject of an anecdote, and deduced quite
rapidly the presence of humour from similar anecdotes, but considers
this anecdote to be too trivial a corollary to be significant, let
alone funny.

An engineer, physicist, and mathematician are all challenged with a
problem: to fry an egg when there is a fire in the house.  The
engineer just grabs a huge bucket of water, runs over to the fire, and
puts it out.  The physicist thinks for a long while, and then measures
a precise amount of water into a container.  He takes it over to the
fire, pours it on, and with the last drop the fire goes out. The
mathematician pores over pencil and paper.  After a few minutes he
goes "Aha!  A solution exists!" and goes back to frying the egg.

Sequel:  This time they are asked simply to fry an egg (no fire).  The
engineer just does it, kludging along; the physicist calculates
carefully and produces a carefully cooked egg; and the mathematician
lights a fire in the corner, and says "I have reduced it to the

An engineer, a mathematician, and a physicist are staying in three
adjoining cabins at a decrepit old motel.

First the engineer's coffee maker catches fire on the bathroom vanity.
He smells the smoke, wakes up, unplugs it, throws it out the window,
and goes back to sleep.

Later that night the physicist smells smoke too.  He wakes up and sees
that a cigarette butt has set the trash can on fire.  He says to
himself, "Hmm. How does one put out a fire?  One can reduce the
temperature of the fuel below the flash point, isolate the burning
material from oxygen, or both.  This could be accomplished by applying
water."  So he picks up the trash can, puts it in the shower stall,
turns on the water, and, when the fire is out, goes back to sleep.

The mathematician, of course, has been watching all this out the
window.  So later, when he finds that his pipe ashes have set the
bedsheet on fire, he is not in the least taken aback.  He immediately
sees that the problem reduces to one that has already been solved and
goes back to sleep.

A company was going to hire someone to do a job.  Given the circumstances,
and the nature of the job, they were not sure if they needed an engineer,
a scientist, or a mathematician.  So the manager devised a test
to decided which one to hire (I know- a manager with imagination
is kind of hard to swallow, but bear with me).

First, the manager brought in he engineer.  Without warning, the
manager tossed a lit match into the waste paper basket, causing an immediate
conflagration.  "Oh my ghod!" shouted the engineer, who the promptly ran
out to the hall, returning with a fire extinguisher he had noticed there
(having broken the glass with his slide rule- who says those things are
worseless?).  Several seconds later, the fire was out, with bits of burned
paper are fire extinguisher foam everywhere.

After the engineer had left, the manager brought in the scientist.  Once
again, the basket of waste organocarbon films were induced to exothermically
react with the di-oxygen molcules in the atmosphere (whoosh).  "Oh my" the
scientist caused to vibrate in the atmospheric substrate.  The scientist
then proceeded to make several measurements of the rapidly occurring
excthermic reactions, related mainly to the rate of said reactions, and
then caused said reactions to cease with a controlled flow of
dihydrooxygen obtained from the faucet in the mens room.  This caused
another data point to be graphed in the experiment the manager was
performing.

After the scientists had left, the mathematician was brought in.  Once
again, the manager caused a graduate thesis to be throughly reviewed
(whoosh).  Upon viewing the nature of the problem, the mathematician
said "The problem is obviously trivial, and will be left as an
exercise to the student."

The first round of tests being completed, the manager was still left
undecided as to which to hire (that should make the manager more
believable).  So another round was decreed, but this time there would
be a twist.  Before being lit, the recycling container would first be
put underneath a horizontal workarea ("desk"), preferably of wooden
construction, so as to add a greater sense of urgency (the possibilty
of said horizontal work-area itself catching fire) and greater
difficulty (the horizontal work area restricting access to the
recycling bin).

Once again, the engineer was brought in, and the waste paper basket
lit.  Once again, the engineer retrieved the fire extinguisher from
the hall, removed the danger of the desk catching fire and the
interference of his aim by desk by kicking said desk over, and put the
fire out.  The engineer then left to post several flames to usenet
anout people who post long, stupid jokes to alt.folore.computers.

Once again, the scientist was brought in, and the exothermic reaction
resumed.  Once again, said reaction was dampened by the measured application
of dihydro-oxygen, once said reaction was removed from underneath the
desk.  The scientist left to write a paper entitle "On the effects of
the application of dihydro-oxgen to the continuing exothermic reactions
of dioxygen and organocarbon polymers."

Once again, the mathematician was brought in, and the thesis reviewed.
Sensing a punchline in the offing, the mathemitican removed the reviewing
thesis from underneath the desk, whereupon he stated "I have reduced
the problem to a trivial problem", and left.

There is a general feeling in the public that IISc/IIT students are fundu,
unassumingly lost in thought almost all the time. And girls fare no better
in this respect. So let us see what a Non IISc/IITain may face when he
marries a girl from this campus.

SCENE: First night of the marriage.

CHARACTERS: IISc/IIT Bride and Non IISc/IIT Groom.

The Groom approaches the Bride and proposes to kiss her. So let us see what
would be her reaction..

GIRL FROM DEPT OF PHYSICS:

"Well kissing is relative. You can kiss me with respect to me or with
respect to you. First define how you are going to kiss. You can kiss me by
treating me in the same reference frame as you are or treating me in a
different inertial frame by producing waves of motion through your lips.
How do you prefer?

The guy faints.

GIRL FROM DEPT OF MATHEMATICS:

"Kissing is fine. You can kiss me provided you satisfy the following
conditions.

Necessary conditions: You should be close to me by a distance delta where
delta is greater than zero and the limit for delta tends to zero and you
satisfy the closure property.

Sufficient conditions: You should have lips. Where the number of lips is
neither more than two nor less than two. You can also kiss by defining your
hand to be me if and only if you satisfy the above conditions.

The guy goes mad.

GIRL FORM ECOLOGICAL SCIENCES:

"Oh Kissing, that is interesting phenomena that occurs in nature.  This is
an initiating process for sex not only found in homosapiens but also in all
heterosapiens, mammals, camels, vertebrates, invertebrates and insects. Out
of 1000 ants observed in a closed laboratory in Zuvinich in Yugoslavia 90%
of them seem to involve in the process of kissing but the subsequence is
very random with probability 0.672139 that a male ant kiss female
ant. First observe the behaviour of ants and cockroaches under various
conditions. That will be very interesting . Isn't it?

The guy has heart attack.

GIRL FROM CS (Computer Science):

"You want to kiss me. That is fine I assume that you know the algorithm for
that very well. But you have to complete the process within 56.22 seconds
or else connection will be timed out.  To optimise the timing lets do
parallel processing. As we have to discuss about our future and other
things, let us do the process of discussion foreground and why can't you
put the process of Kissing background?"

The guy applies for divorce.

GIRL from EE (Electrical Engineering):

"So you would like to kiss me. The process of kissing is an age old
communication process. The information content of the signal transmitted
from one pair of lips to the other is more if the probability of the event
(of kissing) is less. Hence take care.  If you want a successful
communication between us, you should kiss me less often. If the information
content is to be infinite, you should never kiss me at all!"

The guy is found hanging from a fan next day

learning the Periodic Table of the Elements.

She said "Why when I was your age I knew both their
names and weights."

One kid popped up, "Yeah... but teach, there were
so few of them back then."

When Stan Kegel was in college, for a class project in
genetics, he wanted to develop a turkey that had bigger
drumsticks.

Failure after failure resulted, until he finally crossed a turkey
with an ostrich.

Its drumsticks were large enuff, but the bird kept hiding
its head in the yams.

Rene Descartes was sitting at a bar.  The bartender came over and asked if
he would like another drink.  He replied, "I think not."  And he vanished.

Heisenburg was also sitting at the bar.  After Descartes vanished in a puff
of smoke, the bartender walked over to him and asked, "Did you see that?"
To which Heisenberg replied, "I can't be certain."

The bartender then noticed Einstein was there.  So he asked him if he could
believe what had happened.  Einstein replied, "It's all relative."

Then the bartender noticed that Carl Sagan was there.  He walked over to
him and asked, "Can you believe that all these famous people are here in
THIS bar?"  Sagan replied, "No.  Why there must be BILLIONS and BILLIONS of
bars out there."

From: Stan Kegel <kegel@fea.net>

The bartender asked Georg Ohm what had happened, but Ohm resisted giving
any answer.

Meanwhile, Gustav Hertz was having such a great time, that he promised to
return in the future at a much greater frequency.

Robert Boyce commented that he thought everyone was under too much pressure
to come up with an answer to what was happening.

Erwin Shroedinger tried to explain that in the absence of an observer,
Decartes left but at the same time did not leave.

But Alexander Volta disagreed stating there was a potential difference
between his staying or going.

James Watt had had a bad day and said he had come in just to let off a
little steam.

Charles Darwin refused to take a stand on the days events as he was waiting
to see what would evolve.

Thomas Edison stated that he found the whole thing illuminating.

Andre Ampere helped the bartender ascertain that all the statements
were kept current. (Stan Kegel)


From: Tiffany Wimberly <wimbo@arkansas.net>
Via: Puny <puny@yahoogroups.com>

Eli Whitney said, "I believe I will have another gin."

Sir Isaac Newton pondered the gravity of the situation.

Robert Goddard said the situation was not rocket science. (Tiff Wimberly)

From: Cybe R. Wizard <cybe@cyberwizardztower.com>

Ben (Jammin') Franklin told a joke key had heard somewhere, lightning the
spirits of those in the bar.  After he Layden wait, he even suceeded in
lightning Rod's mood.

Archimedes didn't participate.  He was out having a screw.

James Clerke Maxwell sent his demon in to take some of the heat out of the
discussion.

Georg Ohm, though he resisted answering, did provide a tasty treat for the
crowd.  Everyone loved Ohm's slaw.

Isaac Newton didn't appreciate the gravity of the situation.  He spectrum
is at fault for the observation of Descarte's vanishing.  Descartes, had he
still been present, would have agreed.

Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck thought it a constant drain of energy to
contemplate the disappearance.

Einstein, making light of the situation, thought everyone should photon
whether it had really happened or not.  He, himself, didn't give a particle
either way.

John William Strutt, Lord Rayleigh, thought the patronage should scatter,
but with different frequency.

Hans Lippershey, making a spectacle of himself, could only tell us, "cope."

George Francis FitzGerald said that Descartes hadn't vanished at all, merely
contracted with de light to speed him away.

Charles Francois Du Fay gave us nothing but static, leaving it to Ben
(Jammin') Franklin to seperate the pluses from the minuses.

Andre Marie Ampere thinks the current intensity of discussion electrifying.

Steaming James Watt's only concern was for his joules every second.

Gaston Plante thought Descartes should be put in a cell for battery.

William Sturgeon and Joseph Henry made a good gauss at where Descartes had
gone.

Samuel Finley Breese Morse had to leave.  He was relay tapped out.

Alexander Graham Bell didn't believe the disappearance for a second.  He
could telephoney from any distance.

Johann Salomo Christoph Schweigger and Jacques Arsene d'Arsonval were
galvanized into instant action by the sight.

Charles Wheathouse thought that Descartes shunt do that.

Heinrich Fredrich Emil Lenz thought that Descartes should be inducted into
the haul aflame.  Their suggestion's feasability slowly sank to zero as
potential opposition built up.

Nicola Tesla re-coiled at the sight.

From: Allan K <junkmail@gigashadow.dyndns.org>

Both mr. and mrs. Curie thought that Descartes had a radiating
personality, even after his disappearance.

So, now it's your turn.  Who else was there at the bar, and what did they
have to say, or what happened to them?

Proposal: The Human Supercollider

For years now, the science of "anatomy" has been based on nothing but luck
and speculation, shrinking away from addressing the true problem of
uncovering the most basic constituents of the human body in fear of
offending certain puritanical "moral" superstitions. I propose that,
following in the footsteps of particle physics, we construct a tube 5 km
long and about one meter in diameter into each end of which human subjects
can be inserted and accelerated towards each other at upwards of 3*10^4
m/s. Upon collision the net energy should be sufficient to break apart the
subjects into their component parts which will then be captured by a
sophisticated bucket-and-tubing mechanism and classified by the planet's
best anatomists. Only by such means can we ever hope to put the science of
anatomy on a firm footing and shed light on that which has heretofore been
veiled by the darkness of ignorance and fear.

Please donate generously to the cause. Send unmarked, low-denomination
bills to [address deleted]. Ideas for potential subjects are also
appreciated.

5 surgeons are taking a coffee break.

1st surgeon says: "Accountants are the best to operate on because when you
open them up, everything inside is numbered."

2nd surgeon says: "Nah, secretaries are the best. Everything inside them is
in alphabetical order."

3rd responds: "Try geologists, man! Everything inside THEM is color coded."

4th intercedes: "I like engineers...they always understand when you have a
few parts left over at the end."

To which the 5th surgeon, who has been quietly listening to the
conversation, says: "You're all wrong. Lawyers are the easiest.
 There's no guts, no heart, no spine and their head and butt are
interchangeable."

               Genetic linguistics (or linguistic genetics).

This is a very promising field devoted to comparative analysis of genetic
and linguistic texts (sequences). Below is one of the examples:

There are overlapping genes, but to my best knowledge, nobody reported the
same for words. But it could save a lot paper or bandwidth.

Inviting my American colleagues to the conference devoted to biological
consequences of the Chernobyl fallout, which was to be conducted in
Chernobyl itself in the autumn a few years after the catastrophe, I
concluded the letter with the following sentence, trying to remind both
time and place in the same word:

"See you in the fall(out)."

Regrettably, they did not come. (As a matter of fact, I also.)

'In science and mathematics 2+2 always equals 4... unless of course you

Why Yawning Is Contagious: You yawn to equalize the pressure on your
eardrums. This pressure change outside your eardrums unbalances other
people's ear pressures, so they must yawn to even it out.

The earth may spin faster on its axis due to deforestation. Just as a
figure skater's rate of spin increases when the arms are brought in
close to the body, the cutting of tall trees may cause our planet to
spin dangerously fast.

Birds take off at sunrise. On the opposite side of the world, they are

(This month the first cloning of a sheep was announced.  The sheep was
called Dolly, because she was cloned from breast tissue.)

Here are this month's cloning announcements from the AIR Research
Laboratories.

1. We have successfully cloned the bacterium E. coli.

2. A team under the direction of MIT researcher Jim Propp
<propp@math.mit.edu> is combining the latest in cloning research
with recent advances in physics:
        b. As the world knows, Scottish scientists have figured
        out how to create large numbers (well, at least one) of
        identical sheep;
        a. Not long ago, some of Propp's colleagues figured out
        how to create coherent beams of matter-particles (rather
        than just photons).
Propp is combining these ideas to produce the sheep-laser. As yet,
he has not settled on a proper name for the technique ("Livestock
Amplification through ..." is as far as he has gotten). In a
second project, Propp is working to create a Bose condensate of
identical sheep.

Did you know that Rene Descartes met the Hunchback of Notre Dame?

They were both visiting Paris, and met on a ferry crossing the famous
river. Somehow Quasimodo fell overboard. He disappeared under the water
because of the weight of handbells he was carrying on his belt.

As Descartes began a rescue, he shouted, "Quasimodo, I see where you
are," and plopped on his coordinates.

He found Quasimodo was already headed toward shore. He seemed to be
running across the bottom, but then Descartes saw he was dancing!
Descartes signed to him: "What are you doing that for?" Quasimodo signed
back, "Save yourself! I'm happy. I'm just Ringing In The Seine!!"

So Rene reached the shore by bobbing up and down.

An onlooker asked, "How did you do that?"

"I'm a Cartesian diver," replied Descartes. "I realize, 'I sink.'
Therefore I swam."

                        Amazing Historical Find!!!

                        Proof of Time Travel Found
                             By Donovan Jones

        Archaeologist Christopher Priest has found what he claims
to be conclusive proof that time travel is possible and that visitors
from the future have left their mark upon our past.
        The proof, said Priest, was discovered in his very own
front yard. He said, "I was clearing away strata of frozen white
water crystals from the front of my house when I came upon a layer
much harder than the others."
        Priest alleges that this harder layer is a primitive
pathway, used by homo sapiens before the advent of the personal
automobile.
        He said, "The discovery of this primitive path is reason
enough for great celebration in the scientific community, but upon
closer inspection, I found something even more startling."
        Inscribed in the pathway is the cryptic phrase, "Archie +
Veronica 4EVR." It is surrounded by a heart-like shape.
        Priest explained his theory, "Archie and his counterpart
Veronica are clearly the names of the temporal explorers. I believe
that 4EVR is the year that they came from. That's right, they come
from over twenty thousand years in the future."
        Priest theorizes that in the future dates are calculated
on a base seventeen numerical system. "It just makes sense," he
says.
        Public Works spokesman Jacqueline Branigin said, "By our
estimation Mr. Priest's discovery is over twenty years old. Truly
an amazing find."

                           WHY I AM A BIOLOGIST

As my e-mail address indicates, I am a biologist.  People sometimes ask me
why.  After much serious thought, I came up with this explanation: (Yes, it
is original -- mine, completely mine.)

When I first started out, I was going to be a mathematician.  So I took
algebra, but I found that was highly variable.

So, I tried geometry.  And that's where I learned all the angles.

Then I took calculus.  That was truly an integrating experience, but it
definitely had its limits.

After a great deal of consideration, I decided to turn away from math and
give some serious thought to science.

I tried geology, but found that was kind of hard.

Next I tried physics but I knew that would never work.

And even though I'd heard chemists had all the solutions, I finally opted
for biology because, after all, it's a living.

The misnaming of fields of study is so common as to lead to what might be
general systems laws. For example, Frank Harary once suggested the law that
any field that had the word "science" in its name was guaranteed thereby
not to be a science. He would cite as examples Military Science, Library
Science, Political Science, Homemaking Science, Social Science, and
Computer Science. Discuss the generality of this law, and possible reasons
for its predictive power.

>Lothar Bodingbauer


>The Questions!

>1. Did evolution have a plan?

Yes.  It was to turn single-celled slime into multicelled slime.

>2. Why does ice turn your whisky cold?

It doesn't.  It is purely an illusion generated by the psychotropic effects of
the whisky.  In actuality, your whisky is getting *warmer*.

>3. Could the flapping of a butterfly*s wing in Kew Gardens set off a
>hurricane in Bermuda?

Yes, but it is much more likely to get the butterfly eaten by a bird.
Also: The logical conclusion is that if there are about 20 hurricanes in a
year, there can only be 20 butterflies in Kew Gardens.

>4. When is a golf ball in flight travelling at its fastest?

In the car on the way to the golf course.

>5. If you have flipped an evenly weighted coin six times and it has come down
>heads each time, is it more likely to come down heads or tails on the seventh
>go?

It will come down on its edge.

>6. Does the eye work like a television camera?

Yes.  It gives a completely distorted view of reality.

>7. Is there more than one correct scientific explanation for any phenomenon?

Yes.  There is one explanation for each sponsor of the research.  Example: If
NIH is funding your research, smoking causes cancer.  If the tobacco people
are funding it, smoking does not cause cancer.

************************************************************************
>The Questions!
>
>1. Did evolution have a plan?

No.  Absolutely not.  It is just non-equilibrium thermodynamics doing its
thing in an energy rich and aggressive environment - selfish genes
seeking to transmit their information against the ravages of entropy.

>2. Why does ice turn your whisky cold?

The heat of fusion of water is 80 cal/gm. The phase transition of melting
absorbs heat from the surrounding medium

>3. Could the flapping of a butterfly*s wing in Kew Gardens set off a
>hurricane in Bermuda?

Not goddamn likely, no matter how the chaosticians hype.  (The butterfly
must be in China.)

>4. When is a golf ball in flight travelling at its fastest?

At the moment of launch.

>5. If you have flipped an evenly weighted coin six times and it has come down
>heads each time, is it more likely to come down heads or tails on the seventh
>go?

Now that depends upon whether is is an honest coin and an honest flip.
If it an honest coin and flip, prior history is no prediction of future
performance.  If there is systemic bias, prior history is presumptive and
perhaps predictive.

>6. Does the eye work like a television camera?

No.  The mechanisms of detection, transmission... are different.  For
instance, the eye does not raster scan the received image.  Image
processing takes place immeidately within the retina to prevent
"blooming" and ther foibles of a non-dynamic ampliifcation and
limited, static gamma.

>7. Is there more than one correct scientific explanation for any phenomenon?

What does "correct" mean?  Any model, even a heuristic, which delivers
the right answer is accurate.  "Correct" implies a fundamental origin of
structure of the model.  By this criterion, >no< explanation is
"correct."

While on my way up to the 7th (top) floor of the Math building here at
the University of Arizona to turn in my paper, I started reading the
little scribblings people would write on the wall such as "Love makes
the world go round", followed by "With a little help from intrinsic
angular momentum" and such.  (Dang physics students!)

Then I looked up at the lighted numbers above the door that indicate
which floor I was on and read the following (floor numbers in parentheses):

        --                          --

And underneath all that, was written (in red pen, no less):

             "Incomplete proof. Resubmit."


[For the non-math people... e is the natural logarithm 2.71828, pi is 3.1415,
the square root of 17 is 4.12310, 2e is 5.43656, and so forth.]

Instructions:  Read each question thoroughly.  Answer all questions.
Time limit:  4 hours.  Begin immediately.

[Ed:  The full test can be found in the Joka-Cola Classic section.]

PUBLIC SPEAKING.  2500 riot-crazed aborigines are storming the
classroom.  Calm them.  You may use any ancient language except Latin
or Greek.

     The proper response is:  "G'day mates!  Yahoo Serious will be out
     in a few moments.  While you're waiting, I'll just throw a few
     shrimp on the barby for ya, and you can help yourselves to a few
     pots of Foster's.  Right?  Right."

SOCIOLOGY.  Estimate the sociological problems which might accompany
the end of the world.  Construct an experiment to test your theory.

     The only problems would be from the car sales people and lawyers
     on why they can't get to the promised land.  The lawyers will try
     to appeal, and the sales people will try to finance or trade one
     another (for less than blue book) to get in.

ENGINEERING.  The disassembled parts of a high-powered rifle have been
placed in your desk.  You will also find an instruction manual printed
in Swahili.  In ten minutes, a hungry Bengal tiger will be admitted to
the room.  Take whatever action you feel appropriate.  Be prepared to
justify your decision.

     Call management in room.  Inform management that engineering has
     had enough of cleaning up after sales demos and will not tolerate
     this shit.  Storm out of room leaving bewildered management to
     deal with dissasembled rifle and hungry tiger.  I mean, if
     management had been on the ball, the gun would be assembled and
     the tiger would have been fed.

POLITICAL SCIENCE.  There is a red telephone on the desk beside you.
Start World War III.  Report at length on its socio-political effects,
if any.

     Inform Kremlin that our entire nuclear arsenal accidentally
     launched towards them.  This should start a major skirmish.  After
     the exchange and near total destruction of the world, the only
     socio-political effect will be if we have enough shrimp and
     Fosters for the Aborigines who are still waiting for Yahoo Serious
     (they seemed to think that the big flash and noise was another
     Serious invention).

EPISTEMOLOGY.  Take a position for or against the truth.  Prove the
validity of your position.

     I speak the truth.  Everything I say is a lie.

GENERAL KNOWLEDGE.  Describe in detail.  Be objective and specific.

     Life is a scam.

EXTRA CREDIT.  Define the Universe.  Give three examples.
      Time is relative.
      Time is money.
      Money is relative.
      Relatives cost money.
      Time is relative, and don't let your relatives spend too much
            time (or money).
      
      ex 1: Aunt Irma visits.
      ex 2: Aunt Irma won't leave.
      ex 3: You wind up buying Aunt Irma a 1 way ticket to

Supervisee : Yes.

The Tautology prize goes to the lecturer who uttered the gem:
 "If we complicate things they get less simple."

This year's modesty award is given for a phrase spoken by a lecturer
after a rather difficult concept had just been introduced.
 "You may feel that this is a little unclear but in fact I am lecturing
  it extremely well."

Overheard at last year's Archimedeans' Garden Party:
 "Quantum Mechanics is a lovely introduction to Hilbert Spaces!"

A Senior mathematician was asked which language he used for some of
his computing.  He replied that he used a very high level language:

1986

From an algebra lecture:
 "A real gentleman never takes bases unless he really has to."

From the same lecturer:
 "This book fills a well needed gap in the literature."

And another encouraging book review:
 "This book is only for the serious enthusiast; I haven't read it myself."

Two quotes from an electrical engineer (but former mathematician):
 "...but the four-colour theorem was sufficiently true at the time."
 "The whole point of mathematics is to solve differential equations!"

And, as a contrast, a quote from a well known mathematician/physicist:
 "Trying to solve [differential] equations is a youthful aberration
  that you will soon grow out of."

While on the subject how about this fundamental law of physics heard
in General Relativity this year:
 "Nature abhors second order differential equations."

A perplexing quote from a theoretical chemist:
 "...but it might be a quasi-infinite set."
What is a "quasi-infinite set?  Answers on a strictly finite postcard, please.

This year's Modesty Prize is awarded to the lecturer who said:
 "Of course, this isn't really the best way to do it.  But seeing as
  you're not quite as clever as I am - in fact none of you are anywhere
  near as clever as I am - we'll do it this way."

From the same lecturer:
 "Now we'll prove the theorem.  In fact I'll prove it all by myself."

And from a particle physics course:
 "This course will contain a lot of charm and beauty but very little truth."

A comparison between the programming languages BCPL and BSPL:
 "Like BCPL you can omit semicolons almost anywhere."

At the beginning of a course it is important to reassure the audience
about how straight-forward the course is and about how good the
lectures are going to be.
But what about this quote from the beginning of the Galois Theory course:
 "This is going to be an adventure for you...and for me."
Or this one from Statistical Physics:
 "At the meeting in August I put my name down for this course because I
  knew nothing about it."

In the middle of the Stochastic Systems course the lecturer offered
this piece of careers advice:
 "If you haven't enjoyed the material in the last few lectures then a
  career in chartered accountancy beckons."

A lecturer of Linear Systems found the following on his board when he
arrived one morning:
 "Roses are red,
  Violets are blue,
  Greens' functions are boring
  And so are Fourier transforms."

An engineer actually gave an answer to the question of "quasi-infinite" sets:
 "It's one with more than ten elements."
And they wonder why buildings fall over...


1987

From a supervisor:
 "Any theorem in Analysis can be fitted onto an arbitrarily small piece
  of paper if you are sufficiently obscure."

No matter how elegant a course is there will always be occasions when
a certain about of arithmetic is called for:
 "I just want you to have a brief boggle at the belly-busting
  complexity of evaluating this."

A lecturer recently started to use RUNES in his course!  His justification:
 "I need an immediately distinguishable character...so I'll use
  something that no-one will recognize."

From a Special Relativity lecture:
 "...and you find you get masses of energy."

It's nice to see the general-purpose 'nobbling constant' making a
welcome return to Cambridge lectures:
 "This must be wrong by a factor that oughtn't to be too different from
unity."

A flattering comment by a student for his GR supervisor:
 "She's the only person in DAMTP who's a real person rather than an
  abstract machine for doing tripos questions."

A worrying thought from the same student:
 "Sex and drugs?  They're nothing compared with a good proof!"

A description of a lecturer:
 "G----'s a maniacal pixie!!!"

A less polite description of a famous (and notorious) mathematician:
 "I personally think he's the greatest fraud since Cyril Burt!!"
- any guesses ?

Renormalisation holds no fears for this lecturer of Plasma Physics:
 "...and divergent integrals need really sleazy cutoffs."

In the true style of Cambridge Maths Tripos we have the following:
 "Proof of Thm. 6.2 is trivial from Thm. 6.9"

Why do mathematicians insist on using words that already have another
meaning?
 "It is the complex case that is easier to deal with."

And from various seminars in the King's College Research Centre:
 "...the non-uniqueness is exponentially small."
 "I'm not going to say exactly what I mean because I'm not absolutely
  certain myself."
 "It's dangerous to name your children until you know how many you are
  going to have."
 "You don't want to prove theorems that are false."
And that last one wins the Sybil Fawlty Prize for "Stating the
Bleeding Obvious".

A slightly more honest version of "The student can easily see that..." :
 "If you play around with your fingers for a while, you'll see that's true."

Suggestions are welcome on the meaning of this:
 "If it doesn't happen at a corner, but at an edge, it nonetheless
  happens at a corner."
- Eh ?

In a Complex Variables course a long, long, LONG time ago a lecturer
wanted to swap the order of an integral and an infinite sum...
 "To do this we use a special theorem...the theorem that says that
  secretly this is an applied maths course."
I never name my lecturers but he's now head of the Universities Grant
Commission.  And a lot of universities would like to swap him for an
infinite sum.

From an Algebra III lecturer:
 "If you want to prove it the simplest thing is to prove it."

This year's Honesty Prize goes to the natural sciences supervisor, who
replied to a question with
 "Don't ask me. I'm not a mathmo."

And from Oxford...
"This does have physical applications. In fact it's all tied up with
strings."


1988

Good heavens, do I see a lecturer actually noticing the existence of
his audience!
 "Was that clear enough?  Put up your hand if that wasn't clear enough.
  Ah, I thought not."

Snobbery or what?
 "In the sort of parrot-like way you use to teach stats to biologists,
  this is expected minus observed."
Also from statistics:
 "I too would like to know what a statistician actually does."
 "We're not doing mathematics; this is statistics."

"You could define the subspace topology this way, if you were
sufficiently malicious."

 "You mustn't be too rigid when doing Fluid mechanics."

Talk about ulterior motives...
 "This handout is not produced for your erudition but merely so I can
  practice the TeX word-processor."

From 1A NatSci "Cells" course:
 "There are two proteins involved in DNA synthesis, they are called
  DNAsynthase 1 and DNAsynthase 3"

From a Part 2 Quantum Mechanics lecture:
 "Just because they are called 'forbidden' transitions does not mean
  that they are forbidden.  They are less allowed than allowed
  transitions, if you see what I mean."

From an IBM Assembler lecture:
 "If you find bear droppings around your tent, it's fairly likely that
  there are bears in the area."

A Biochemistry paper included an analysis of a previously undiscovered
sugar named by the researchers "godnose".

From a 1B Electrical Engineering lecture:
 "This isn't true in practice - what we've missed out is Stradivarius's
  constant."
And then the aside:
 "For those of you who don't know, that's been called by others the
  fiddle factor..."

One from a 1A Engineering maths lecture:
 "Graphs of higher degree polynomials have this habit of doing unwanted
  wiggly things."

"Apart from the extra line, that's a one line proof."
"This is a one line proof...if we start sufficiently far to the left."

A slight difficulty occured with geometry in an Engineering lecture
one day:
 "This is the maximum power triangle" said a lecturer, pointing to a rectangle.

This year the Computer Scientists seem to be in the running for the
Honesty Award:
 "Sorry, I should have made that completely clear.  This is a shambles."

From a Computer Sciences Protection lecture:
 "Who should be going to this lecture?  Everyone...apart from the third
  year of the two-year CompSci course."

"I don't want to go into this in detail, but I would like to
illustrate some of the tedium."

Oh those poor CompScis....
 "I'm not going to get anything more useful done in this lecture, so I
  might as well talk."
later followed by ...
 "Well there you are, one lecture with no useful content."

Three from a NatSci Physics lecturer:
 "You don't have to copy that down -- there's no wisdom in it -- it
  only repeats what I said."
 "We now wish to show that they are not merely equal but _the same thing_."
 "And before I leave this subject, I would like to tell you something
  interesting."

From a first year chemistry lecture some personal problems of the lecturer:
 "Before I started this morning's lecture I was going to tell you about my
  third divorce but on reflection I thought I'd better tell my wife first."

From a single research seminar at the King's College Research Centre:
 "I'm sure it's right whether it's valid or not."
 "WARNING: There is no reason to believe this will work."

1990:

A nomination for the Sybil Fawlty "Stating the Bleedin' Obvious" Prize:

"A polynomial f is said to have degree m, written deg f equals m, if it
does have degree m."

Now it is fairly well known that lectures are not supposed to be copied
down mindlessly. But...

"Recall word 2 of defn 2.1" But then again...

"I know you all have very innocent minds, but occasionally a word should be
allowed to wander through before reaching the paper."

And on the subject of teaching styles:

"Proof left as an exercise for your supervisor."

And this year's first contenders for the Tautology award:

"It's obvious that what I've just written down is obvious."

"The fixed element can be said to be exactly what it is."

Mathematical notation is a minefield of obscure symbols ranging over most
alphabets and scriptstyles. Any guesses for which character was described
by an undergraduate as:

"It's a script spider"?

And with the reading problems come the corresponding writing ones suffered
by these lecturers:

"My script 'y's always end up looking like rabbits."

"Little mouse tensored with piece of cheese."

However, good notation has its rewards as described by this lecturer:

"The prime leaps on to the other factor in a most convenient fashion."

And now, back to the content of the lecture courses:

"You can hardly underestimate the importance of this."

"I've got a lot to say about this theorem, so don't stop me if I go too
fast."

"Sometimes it's useful to know how large your zero is"

Three from the same lecturer who is clearly having real problems...

"What am I doing? I haven't written any damn thing yet - I've just written
total rubbish."

"What am I talking about? Does anyone know what I'm talking about? This is
rubbish."

"Every time I go to the board with these notes I write down something
completely different."

Hmmm... do I detect someone almost as cynical as myself?

"Theoretical physicist - a physicist whose existence is postulated, to make
the numbers balance, but who is never actually observed in the laboratory."

A IB Chemistry lecturer, refering to a previously derived equation.

"This is rigorous. Well, it's rigorous in the sense that ... All right,
it's not rigorous."

Certain calulations will always be CPU intensive...

"This principle is sometimes known as assuming the CIA is paying our
computing bills."

Letter from an editor:

"I very much regret to inform you that the review procedure of your paper
'Approximation of Delay systems by Fourier-Laguerre series', is incurring a
delay..."

                              Teacher Quotes
Insights of a warped mind

Every once in a while one of my teachers will say something that makes me
think twice, and I find myself FORCED to write it down.  Then I tend to
add to it.  You can see some of the strange? wierd? interesting? results
below.

The original teacher quotes are surrounded by asterisks.  Read at your own
risk.

*You hit a node*.  It is angry.  It eats you.

*Nothing happens instantaneously.*  You can just be sitting around,
talking about the weather and maybe drinking some brew, when all of a
sudden, bang, Nothing happens.  It's kind of scary.

*Reject the null*
"Sure, reject me.  Just like everyone else.  That's what they all say:
`Reject the null, he's no good, you don't want him.'  Well, maybe I have
feelings, too.  I'm sick of being rejected.  No one wants me.  No one likes
me.  Maybe I want some warm fuzzies instead of cold pricklies.  Oh, I can
see it's no use.  No matter how many self-help books I read, nothing will
change.  I'll just fade into oblivion someday.  Nobody cares.  No one will
even notice."
"Wow, I didn't know he'd feel that badly about it."
"Don't worry about the null, he's always like that.  If he was fun to be
around, do you think we'd reject him?"

*Some elementary particle whose name you don't recall.*  This can be
really embarrasing at parties.  Expecially since most elementary particles
don't have an ounce of tact and tend to be extremely offended if you don't
remember their names.  Sometimes, they'll throw their punch at you.  Then
you have to go through the rest of the party with punch all over your good
clothes.  People will ask you, "Did you forget an elementary particle's
name again?"

*I just pulled polynomials out of my hat.*

*The probe is flashing.* Call the cops!

*I don't have any problems.*  Nope, sorry, ma'am.  I'm fresh out of them.
Sold my last one 2 weeks ago.  Yes, I know you always have relied on me to
sell you stuff, but I just don't have any problems for you, ma'am.  If I'd
have known that you were going to need some, why of course I'd have gotten
some for you.  But I hadn't the faintest idea.

*You have a problem if you know about gravitation.*

*Make the proof work.*  The best way to do this is to stand over with a
whip.  Craack!  "Ow!"  "Work, you lily-livered excuse for a proof!"

*Often you have to count how many times you write "poof".*

*I can't read, either.*  Which raises the question of what I'm doing in a
responsible position as your teacher but does resolve the point of why I
accidently had you buy "Fun with knitting" instead of "Miserable,
horrible, and really ugly equations."

*It was radioactive material, and we had to store it.*  We decided to bury
it in mean old Mr. Jones' backyard because of the way he kept shooting our
dogs and strangling our cats when we were kids.  So far, he's only grown
one extra leg, and his eyes have turned orange, but it doesn't seem to
bother him.  Last time we checked on him, he was chasing along after
some kid's poor Siamese cat, all his (Mr. Jones') three legs going,
yowling as loud as the cat was.  I guess we'll have to try something else.

Following the merger of the Geology and Geography departments at Central
Michigan University, the following flyer appeared in faculty mailboxes:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

To the University Community:

Many misconceptions are circulating among the faint-hearted about
reorganization and its potential consequences.  We wish to express our
support for the bold leadership of Provost Frank in his creative
approach to combining departments and reorganizing schools.  We believe
reorganization can lead to a new era of intellectual florescence on
this campus.  Taking a hint from another similarly situated
institution, in which the motto of the newly-created Small Business and
Men's Physical Education Institute is:  "Pulling oneself up by one's
own jockstrap", we urge the administration to consider the following
possibilities as models for future reorganizations:

     Department of Military Science, Religion, and Political Science -
          or "Department of Propaganda Arts"

     Department of Biology and Rhetoric - or "Department of
          Decomposition"

     Department of Accounting and Fashion - "No Taste for Accounting"

     Department of Clinical Psychology and Gerontology - or "Still
          Crazy After All These Years"

     Department of Philosophy and Nutrition - or "Healthy Mind, Healthy
          Body -- Take Your Pick"

     Department of Geology and Men's Physical Education - or
          "Department of Hard Knocks"

     Department of Theater and Journalism - or "Show and Tell"

     Department of Mycology and Men's Studies - or "He's a fun guy"

     Department of Mathematics, Romance Languages, and Dance - or
          "Department of Order and Disorder"


These are only some of the more self-evident possibilities, but we urge
creative minds to propose their own combinations.

                NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK JOKE

Q: How do you find a needle in a haystack?

Scientist says: One draws up a research and development proposal for a new
and improved device, costing $100m in budget and just under $200m on final
completion. The device can harvest for needles in any given haystack in any
terrain at any time, and operated by remote or even hands-on control.

Chaotician says: Faced with such a heterogeneous organisation of data you
assemble a bunch of friends (say ten or less, or maybe more if there is free
alcohol) and hold a party on the haystack. Someone will be bound to find the
needle by stepping or sitting on it. Or if they don't something much more
strange + interesting will appear, so that the needle is classified as a
variant hay-straw. And the new discovery classified as the strange attractor.

PCE________________________________________________________________________
From: Tom Dowling <tdowling@lsc.org>
I work at Liberty Science Center, a hands-on museum in New Jersey.  I wrote
a pile of scientist and inventor limericks for our newsletter, most never
got published because there were too many.  They focus mostly on history of
science & technology.

                     A Collection of Little Limericks
                      About Scientists and Inventors

The explanation or background in regular type, followed by the "poem" in bold face.

Massage your brain with these,
Then spread the Limerick disease,
Via the net,
To see what we'll get,
Beware, your computer might sneeze.

Thomas Edison, Working in Menlo Park, NJ (now part of Edison Township)
perfected incandescent lighting in 1879, improving on Swan's (and other's)
efforts.  He then devised the electrical generation and distribution system
to make it useful.

Tom Edison thought he was bright,
He invented the electric light,
Then, to his chagrin,
When turning in,
His wife said, "I'll be reading tonight."

Samuel F. B. Morse, otherwise a painter, invented a "magnetic telegraph" in
1837 and with his assistant Alfred Vail later developed Morse code.

Morse was a man of deep thought,
And a painter whose art wasn't bought,
He invented a key,
And his fame was to be,
Tapping out: "What hath god wrought?"

Alexander Graham Bell's original focus was on hearing and speech.  He (is
said to have) uttered the famous words (abbreviated below) in 1876, while
attempting to improve the telephone of 1875.  He had spilled sulfuric acid
from a battery into his lap.

Bell wanted to help the deaf hear,
And was building an electric ear,
Then acid he spilled,
Where he wasn't thrilled,
And quickly called, "Watson, come here."

The Wright brothers made the world's first powered, controlled airplane
flight on September 15, 1904, with Orville at the controls.  They chose a
breezy, sandy location at Kitty Hawk, NC to assist take off and cushion
landings.

We all know the brothers Wright,
And credit them with first flight.
They soon had to land,
With their butts in the sand,
But their wires and sticks were all right.
[or, Thank goodness their props were on tight.]

Albert Einstein proposed his theory of special relativity in 1905, followed
by general relativity in 1916.  Time dilation is one of the consequences of
motion at relativistic speeds.

Einstein proposed that time,
Was flexible and most sublime,
Go near fast as light,
And to you delight,
You'll get home while still in your prime.

Antoine-Henri Becquerel discovered natural radioactivity from uranium in
1896.  A uranium compound exposed a photographic plate through a lightproof
wrapper.

Becquerel was having a go,
At what made substances glow,
With uranium he played,
And discoveries he made,
But that was the end of his show.

Cyrus Hall McCormick invented his harvesting machine, the reaper, in 1831.
The reaper revolutionized farming, by allowing fewer workers to operate
larger farms.

McCormick invented the reaper,
And the wheat fields grew wider and deeper,
The farmers got lazy,
And drank themselves hazy,
But his gadget was still a keeper.

 Nicolas-Léonard-Sadi Carnot published Reflections on the Motive Power of
Fire, in 1824, the first scientific analysis of steam engines, laying the
foundations of thermodynamics.

Carnot performed quite a feat,
He developed a cycle complete,
From torrid to cold,
His theories do hold,
And thus he's remembered in heat.

James Naysmith designed the steam hammer in 1838 to forge a huge wrought
iron paddle shaft for a ship.  The hammer was belatedly patented in 1843,
after copies of his invention had already been made.

Scotsman Nasmyth was said,
To have hammers inside of his head,
While others laughed,
He forged a great shaft,
By pounding it while it was red.

William Shockley, John Bardeen and Walter Brattain invented the first transistor, at Bell Labs, in New Jersey, in 1948.

Schockley, Brattain and Bardeen,
Commanding electrons unseen,
Made vacuum tubes,
Fit only for rubes,
And those who think progress obscene.

Marie Sklodowska Curie and her husband Pierre Curie discovered radium and
polonium in 1898.  They both suffered from radiation injuries while
purifying the highly radioactive element radium.

Madame Curie loved Pierre,
And together found elements rare,
But they stood way to close,
And got quite a dose,
And suffered from falling of hair.

 Alfred Bernhard Nobel invented dynamite in1866.  He later invented
gelatin-dynamite and thus founded an explosives dynasty.  His endowment
funds the Nobel Prizes.

Rare medals recall Nobel,
Who thought dynamite to be swell,
He mixed "nitro" with dust,
For a product to trust,
So we could all blow each other to hell.
[or, For warfare and mining as well.]

Louis Temple, an African-American blacksmith, invented the "Temple Toggle"
harpoon, which revolutionized whaling in 1848.  The toggle harpoon would
not cut itself free, thus reducing the number of lost whales.

In whaling days Temple was king,
His harpoon had a terrible sting,
It made sad predations,
On the noble cetaceans,
And extinction it nearly did bring.

Garret A. Morgan, an African-American inventor, patented a forerunner of
the modern traffic signal in 1923.

Morgan's ideas were so great,
'Though he suffered racism and hate,
An invention that's vexing,
And sometimes perplexing,
His revenge is our traffic light wait.

Crompton's mule was one of the machines that revolutionized the production
of cloth in the eighteenth century; he invented the mule in 1779, combining
Hargreaves' spinning jenny and Arkwright's water frame.  Displaced workers
opposed these inventions.

Crompton invented the mule,
A serious yarn spinning tool,
It put many poor slobs,
Right out of their jobs,
And today this is still the rule.

 Louis Pasteur is well known for his development and first human use of the
rabies vaccine on July 6, 1885.  His lesser-known early work was in optical
isomers, compounds that twist light left or right depending on their exact
molecular configuration.

Louis Pasteur, in his day,
Studied compound that swing either way,
No ifs, ands or maybes,
He paused to beat rabies,
Because isomers could stand the delay.

Nikola Tesla developed the first AC induction motor in 1888 and with George
Westinghouse developed the modern AC electrical system.  He built a huge
tower at Wardencliffe (NY) in a failed test of wireless, high frequency
electric power.  Today, Tesla has become a cult figure, with fringe
enthusiasts linking him to UFO's, time travel and anti-gravity machines.

Tesla thought himself greatest of all,
His "juice" is what comes from your wall,
An Edison rival,
Who's had a revival,
Thought the Wardencliffe tower did fall.

Thomas Newcomen developed the first "atmospheric" steam engine in about
1712. It was massively inefficient and was quickly supplanted when James
Watt's designs arrived in 1765. Watt's engine was inspired by his efforts
to repair a Newcomen machine.

Newcomen thought he would try,
To build something to suck the mines dry,
It ate coal by the ton,
And was trouble to run,
'Till someone named Watt happened by.

 Evangelista Torricelli invented the mercury barometer in 1643.  Blasie
Pascal actually made the mountain ascent, shortly after news of the
discovery reached France.

Nobody recalls Torricelli,
They think it might come from the deli,
Pascal then climbed,
Upon mountains rimed,
With a barometer strapped to his belly.

Howard Hughes, son of the inventor of the tri-cone oil well drill bit, was
an aviator and aircraft inventor.  His famous "Spruce Goose" a seaplane
built mainly of plywood is still the largest (320 foot wingspan) airplane
ever. It flew just once, on November 2, 1947.

There was once a flyer named Hughes,
With many strange airplanes to use,
His Goose was a riot,
But he really did fly it,
Relying on plywood and glues.

Henry Ford developed the modern assembly line in the fist decade of the
20th century.  Carl Fredrich Bentz developed the first working gasoline
automobile in 1885, much earlier than Ford's first (1893).

Ford did not invent the car,
The Germans were quicker by far,
But he found a way,
To make hundreds a day,
And that's how things got as they are.

Igor Ivanovich Sikorski built the first functional helicopter, the VS-300
in 1939.  He was an aviation pioneer and previously built the first
multi-engine aircraft.

Sikorski perfected the chopper,
With rotors and engines most proper,
With blades in a whirl,
He could pick up his girl,
And fly to place he could drop her.

Amedeo Avrogado originated the key hypothesis in the molecular theory of
gasses beginning with an 1811 paper.  Later scientists including Perrin
(1909) and Millikan (1917) worked towards accurate determinations of N0,
(Avrogado's number), now held to be 6.022045 x 1023.

Avrogodo conceived a number,
Used to make Chem' students slumber.
He cast atoms and moles,
In mathematical roles,
Which give us such pains to remember.

 Heinrich Rudolph Hertz demonstrated electromagnetic waves in 1888.
Gugliemo Marconi took out the first (UK) patent on radio in 1896.  Karl
F. Braun invented the crystal receiver, and shared the Nobel Prize (1909)
with Marconi.

Marconi sent signals through air,
On waves of which Hertz was aware,
With sparkers and bristles,
On galena crystals,
'Till radios were found everywhere.

John Phillip Holland, working in Paterson, NJ, developed the first modern
submarines. The Fenian Ram was an experimental 3-man boat of 1881.  The
Plunger was to be the first diesel sub, but was never finished, c. 1901.

The Plunger and Fenian Ram,
Were two boats that just barely swam,
They were Holland's folly,
But gee-whiz and golly,
Soon navies their offspring would damn.

Robert Hooke, a brilliant and versatile scientist, is remembered for his
Micrographia of 1665, a work containing images of microscopic creatures and
an "undulatory" (wave) theory of light.

Old Hooke, he looked at flea,
And others that bite you and me,
With pictures and words,
Described cork and curds,
And the parasites of bird and bee.


 Newton devised his famous laws of motion between 1684 and 1686.
Although he had the ideas earlier (1665-6). Newton shares credit for the
calculus with Willhelm Gottfreid Leibniz (published 1684) but in their day
there was much acrimony between them.

Newton was brilliant of mind,
A genius of rarest kind,
His new laws of motion,
Caused quite a commotion,
But Leibniz shared his best find.

 Leo Szliard demonstrated the nuclear fission chain reaction of U-235 while
working with Walter Zinn at Columbia University in 1939.  He persuaded
Einstein to write the famous letter to Roosevelt.  Szliard joined Fermi on
the first nuclear reactor in 1942, and turned to biophysics after the war.

Do you know Leo Szliard?
He never though physics was hard.
Then scientist-spooks,
Stole the plans to the nukes,
So shelters we built in our yard.

In Massachusetts, Robert Hutchings Goddard designed and flew the first
practical liquid fuel rocket in 1926.  Supported by a Smithsonian grant, he
moved on to test ever-larger rockets in the desert near Roswell, NM.
Goddard was the first to work out the physics of a manned moon mission, but
did not live to see it done.

Rockets were launched in Roswell,
A place that is hotter than hell,
They say men from space,
Have crashed in the place,
Where Goddard's old missiles once fell.

Willhelm Röentgen discovered X-rays (sometimes called Roentgen rays in his
honor) in 1895 while experimenting with Crookes (electrical discharge)
tubes.  The medical uses were almost immediately appreciated.

The integument used to so hide,
The organs and bones deep inside,
'Till Röentgen discovered,
Rays that uncovered,
Whatever was wounded, save pride.

Sir Fredric Banting, a surgeon and Charles Best, a physiologist isolated
insulin in November of 1921.  The gathering of flies at the sugary urine of
dogs that had undergone pancreatectomy was a crucial clue.

Researchers Banting And Best,
Were doing a pancreas test,
They saw the flies huddle,
At a sugary puddle,
And with insulin the world was blessed.

Clarence "Kelly" Johnson was one of the world's greatest aircraft
designers.  He created the P-38 of WWII, the F-104, the U-2 and the Mach 3+
SR-71 Blackbird reconnaissance aircraft of c. 1964.

"Kelly" could p*ss off [or, torment] the Reds,
With his sleek titanium sleds.
The swiftest of Migs,
Seemed slow as pigs,
When the Blackbird flew over their heads.

Alan Mathison Turing, a British mathematician described a "Turing Machine"
in 1937 and the "Turing Test" in 1950.  During WWII he worked at Bletchley
Park on electromechanical computers that helped defeat the supposedly
invulnerable Nazi "Enigma" ciphers.  His top-secret clearance was later
revoked because of his sexual orientation.

Turing was scorned in his day,
When it wasn't OK to be gay,
But his electronic brain,
Gave Hitler a pain,
Taking the cloak of enigma away.

John Harrison, English, (1693-1776) was a horologist (clock maker).  He
sought the Longitude prize, of £20,000 for a method of determining a ship's
position at sea.  He built several chronometers, from 1735 on, to the
famous No.4 (1757) a mere 5 inches in diameter.  Harrison was finally
awarded the Longitude prize in 1773.  For the whole story, see The
Illustrated Longitude, by Dava Sobel, now available as an illustrated
edition, too.

For ages, the ships on the sea,
Could not reckon where they might be,
Till Harrison's eyes,
Saw the longitude prize,
A true clock for the Admiral-ty.

Problem: To Catch a Lion in the Sahara Desert.
(Hunting lions in Africa was originally published as "A contribution
to the mathematical theory of big game hunting" in the American
Mathematical Monthly in 1938 by "H. Petard, of Princeton NJ" [actually
the late Ralph Boas].  It has been reprinted several times.
This is a hugely extended version with contributions from the net.

1. Mathematical Methods

1.1 The Hilbert (axiomatic) method

We place a locked cage onto a given point in the desert.  After that
we introduce the following logical system:
   Axiom 1: The set of lions in the Sahara is not empty.
   Axiom 2: If there exists a lion in the Sahara, then there exists a
            lion in the cage.
   Procedure: If P is a theorem, and if the following is holds:
              "P implies Q", then Q is a theorem.
   Theorem 1: There exists a lion in the cage.

1.2 The geometrical inversion method

We place a spherical cage in the desert, enter it and lock it from
inside.
Case 1: The lion is inside the cage. This case is trivial.
Case 2: The lion is outside the cage. We then perform an inversion
with respect to the cage.  Then the lion is inside the cage, and we
are outside.
Warning: With this method, it is important not to stand in the middle
of the cage, as one will disappear in the infinite.

1.3 The projective geometry method

Without loss of generality, we can view the desert as a plane surface.
We project the surface onto a line and afterwards the line onto an
interior point of the cage. Thereby the lion is mapped onto that same
point.

1.4 The Bolzano-Weierstrass method

Divide the desert by a line running from north to south.  The lion is
then either in the eastern or in the western part.  Let's assume it is
in the eastern part.  Divide this part by a line running from east to
west.  The lion is either in the northern or in the southern part.
Let's assume it is in the northern part.  We can continue this process
arbitrarily and thereby constructing with each step an increasingly
narrow fence around the selected area.  The diameter of the chosen
partitions converges to zero so that the lion is caged into a fence of
arbitrarily small diameter.
Warning: With this method take care that the beautifull skin of the
lion is not damaged.

1.5 The set theoretical method

We observe that the desert is a separable space.  It therefore
contains an enumerable dense set of points which constitutes a
sequence with the lion as its limit. With a cage on our backs,
we jump from point to point of this sequence an so approach the lion
as near as we like.

1.6 The Peano method

In the usual way construct a curve containing every point in the
desert.  It has been proven [1] that such a curve can be traversed in
arbitrarily short time.  Now we traverse the curve, carrying a spear,
in a time less than what it takes the lion to move a distance equal to
its own length.

1.7 A topological method

We observe that the lion possesses the topological gender of a torus.
We embed the desert in a four dimensional space.  Then it is possible
to apply a deformation [2] of such a kind that the lion when returning
to the three dimensional space is all tied up in itself.  It is then
completely helpless.

1.8 The Cauchy method

We examine a lion-valued function f(z). Be \zeta the cage.  Consider
the integral

          1    [   f(z)
       ------- I --------- dz
       2 \pi i ] z - \zeta

               C

where C represents the boundary of the desert.  Its value is f(zeta),
i.e. there is a lion in the cage [3].

1.9 The Wiener-Tauber method

We obtain a tame lion, L_0, from the class L(-\infinity,\infinity),
whose fourier transform vanishes nowhere.  We put this lion somewhere
in the desert.  L_0 then converges toward our cage.  According to the
general Wiener-Tauner theorem [4] every other lion L will converge
toward the same cage.  (Alternatively we can approximate L arbitrarily
close by translating L_0 through the desert [5].)

From: chohn@vub.ac.be (Ohn Christian)

1.10 The Mathematical Induction method

Consider, for each n, the following statement:
    P(n) : 'It is possible to catch n lions in the desert.'
Of course, P(n) is true for large enough n, because the lions are then
so tightly packed together that it is easy to catch them. But now,
P(n) implies P(n-1) ('cause if you catch some lions, you can always
release one of them). Hence, P(1) is true.

1.11 The Banachsche or iterative method

Let f be a contraction of the Sahara in it with contraction point x_0.
On this point we put the cage. By successive iteration W(n+1)= f(W(n)),
n=,1,2,..... (W(0)=Sahara) the Sahara will be contracted to X_0. In this
way the lion will get in the cage.

1.12 The Kalra Method

Make a list of the lion's whereabouts.  Classify them into different fuzzy
sets. The lion will get confused and fall into your trap.

1.13 The Cartesian method

Take the origin as close as possible to the lion. Then perform rotation
operation again and again. Initially, the lion will feel dizzy. Finally it
will fall down.

1.14 The Inductive Method

 Initial Condition: If you center a large cage on any one
grain of sand, and a lion is on or close to the grain of sand. then
he will be trapped by the cage. By close we mean within epsilon
grains of sand. Given a cage the size of 2 * (size of lion *
epsilon) it works.
 First Hypothesis: Given the first grain of sand in the
desert, if the lion is standing on it you will trap him.

       Proof: Given by the initial condition.

       Induction Hypothesis:  Assume that a lion is on a grain

of sand n, and is trappable. Now, for grain n+1 (assume all grains of sand
are ordered, inorder) n+1 is close to n, hence n is close to n+1. If the
lion is on grain n, and is trappable; then he is close to n+1, and by the
above condition, trappable.  Hence, no matter where the lions are if you
drop a cage centered on a piece of sand you will catch a lion.

1.15 The Integro-Differential Method

Integrate the Sahara over its entire surface. The lion is now somewhere in
the result. Differentiate the result w.r.t the earth's rotation. The
resulting value is zero, and the lion is no more.

From: David J Corbett <djc123@student.canterbury.ac.nz>
1.16  Group theory method
Note that "dog in lace" is an anagram of "caged lion".
Therefore, apply the appropriate permutation from S9 on a dog in lace to
obtain a caged lion.  The matter of obtaining a dog in lace is left to
the reader.

2 Theoretical Physics Methods

2.1 The Dirac method

We assert that wild lions can ipso facto not be observed in the Sahara
desert.  Therefore, if there are any lions at all in the desert, they
are tame.  We leave catching a tame lion as an exercise to the reader.

2.2 The Schroedinger method

At every instant there is a non-zero probability of the lion being in
the cage.  Sit and wait.

2.3 The Quantum Measurement Method

We assume that the sex of the lion is _ab initio_ indeterminate.  The
wave function for the lion is hence a superposition of the gender
eigenstate for a lion and that for a lioness.  We lay these eigenstates
out flat on the ground and orthogonal to each other.  Since the (male)
lion has a distinctive mane, the measurement of sex can safely be made
from a distance, using binoculars.  The lion then collapses into one of
the eigenstates, which is rolled up and placed inside the cage.

2.4 The nuclear physics method

Insert a tame lion into the cage and apply a Majorana exchange
operator [6] on it and a wild lion.

As a variant let us assume that we would like to catch (for argument's
sake) a male lion.  We insert a tame female lion into the cage and
apply the Heisenberg exchange operator [7], exchanging spins.

2.5 The Newton gravitation method

Cage and lion attract each other with the gravitation force. We neglect
the friction. This way the lion will arive sooner or later in the cage.

2.6 The Newton third law method

Let the lion catch you (let's assume you remain alive here).  For every
action there is an equal and opposite reaction.  Therefore, you will have
captured the lion.

2.7 The Special relativistic method

One moves over the desert with light velocity. The relativistic length
contraction makes the lion flat as paper. One takes it, rolls it up and
puts a rubber band around the lion.

2.8 The Special relativistic method (method 2)

Run in the direction opposite to that of the lion. The relative velocity
makes the lion run faster and hence he feels heavier and gets tired.

2.9 The general relativistic method

All over the desert we distribute lion bait containing large amounts
of the companion star of Sirius.  After enough of the bait has been
eaten we send a beam of light through the desert.  This will curl
around the lion so it gets all confused and can be approached without
danger.

2.10 The Heisenberg method

Position and Velocity from a moving lion can not be measure at the same
time. As moving lions have no physical meaningfull position in the desert,
one can not catch them. The lion hunt can therefore be limited to
resting lions. The catching of a resting, not moving lion is left as
an exercise for the reader.

2.11 The Schroedinger cat method
From: Alain Gottcheiner <agot@ulb.ac.be>

I'm no specialist of quantum mechanics, so it's possible that I've
overlooked something important, but the following method should work :

1) Note that a lion is nothing else than some big cat.

2) Pour some contact poison that's lethal to lions over the Sahara.

3) Thereafter, either the lion is dead, or it isn't.  So look at the Sahara
to reduce the lion's state to either dead or alive.  If he's dead, you will
have no problems picking him and putting him in the cage. If it is not,
proceed back to step 2.

4) Since the probability (P) of this trick working is not 0, and since
[limit, on n going to infinite, of 1 minus P to the nth, is O] you've got
1OO% probability of some iteration of the process bringing up the result
you wanted.

There could just be a snag about the method : if the lion is dead,
obvioulsy he's not moving anymore, and his momentum is known to be nought,
so how are you going to measure where he is lying ?


2.appendix The Heisenberg constriction

You will disturb the lion when you observe it before capturing.
So keep your eyes closed.

3 Experimental Physics Methods

3.1 The thermodynamics method

We construct a semi-permeable membrane which lets everything but lions
pass through.  This we drag across the desert.

3.2 The atomic fission method

We irradiate the desert with slow neutrons.  The lion becomes
radioactive and starts to disintegrate. Once the disintegration
process is progressed far enough the lion will be unable to resist.

3.3 The magneto-optical method

We plant a large, lense shaped field with cat mint (nepeta cataria)
such that its axis is parallel to the direction of the horizontal
component of the earth's magnetic field.  We put the cage in one of the
field's foci . Throughout the desert we distribute large amounts of
magnetized spinach (spinacia oleracea) which has, as everybody knows,
a high iron content.  The spinach is eaten by vegetarian desert
inhabitants which in turn are eaten by the lions.  Afterwards the
lions are oriented parallel to the earth's magnetic field and the
resulting lion beam is focussed on the cage by the cat mint lense.

4 Contributions from Computer Science.

4.1 The search method

We assume that the lion is most likely to be found in the direction to
the north of the point where we are standing.  Therefore the REAL
problem we have is that of speed, since we are only using a PC to
solve the problem.

4.2 The parallel search method.

By using parallelism we will be able to search in the direction to the
north much faster than earlier.

4.3 The Monte-Carlo method.

We pick a random number indexing the space we search.  By excluding
neighboring points in the search, we can drastically reduce the number
of points we need to consider.  The lion will according to probability
appear sooner or later.

4.4 The practical approach.

We see a rabbit very close to us.  Since it is already dead, it is
particularly easy to catch.  We therefore catch it and call it a lion.

4.5 The common language approach.

If only everyone used ADA/Common Lisp/Prolog, this problem would be
trivial to solve.

4.6 The standard approach.

We know what a Lion is from ISO 4711/X.123.  Since CCITT have specified
a Lion to be a particular option of a cat we will have to wait for a
harmonized standard to appear.  $20,000,000 have been funded for
initial investigations into this standard development.

4.7 Linear search.

Stand in the top left hand corner of the Sahara Desert.  Take one step
east.  Repeat until you have found the lion, or you reach the right
hand edge.  If you reach the right hand edge, take one step
southwards, and proceed towards the left hand edge.  When you finally
reach the lion, put it the cage.  If the lion should happen to eat you
before you manage to get it in the cage, press the reset button, and
try again.

4.8 The Dijkstra approach:

The way the problem reached me was: catch a wild lion in the Sahara
Desert. Another way of stating the problem is:

       Axiom 1: Sahara elem deserts
       Axiom 2: Lion elem Sahara
       Axiom 3: NOT(Lion elem cage)

We observe the following invariant:

       P1:     C(L) v not(C(L))

where C(L) means: the value of "L" is in the cage.

Establishing C initially is trivially accomplished with the statement

       ;cage := {}

Note 0:
This is easily implemented by opening the door to the cage and shaking
out any lions that happen to be there initially.
(End of note 0.)

The obvious program structure is then:

       ;cage:={}
       ;do NOT (C(L)) ->
               ;"approach lion under invariance of P1"
               ;if P(L) ->
                       ;"insert lion in cage"
                [] not P(L) ->
                       ;skip
               ;fi
       ;od

where P(L) means: the value of L is within arm's reach.

Note 1:
Axiom 2 ensures that the loop terminates.
(End of note 1.)

Exercise 0:
Refine the step "Approach lion under invariance of P1".
(End of exercise 0.)

Note 2:
The program is robust in the sense that it will lead to
abortion if the value of L is "lioness".
(End of note 2.)

Remark 0: This may be a new sense of the word "robust" for you.
(End of remark 0.)

Note 3:

From observation we can see that the above program leads to the
desired goal. It goes without saying that we therefore do not have to
run it.
(End of note 3.)
(End of approach.)

4.9 The Linked List Method

Make a linked list of all objects in the desert. Then delete the pointers
on either side of the lion.(Make sure you are not AFTER the lion.)

4.10 The Automata Method

Use a Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton with epsilon moves from all states
to the final state, and no moves from the final state. The lion will soon
enter the final state and be trapped.

4.11 The Divide And Conqure Method (by recursion)

Divide the desert in half. Repeat the process until you have the lion, a
grain of sand, or some other object that cannot be divided without blood
shed. You have the lion. The order of this method = O(insane). (Where
sanity is anything reasonable.)

5 Other Methods

5.1 The Time-Cop Method

Use a time-machine and take the entire Sahara back a few years in time. The
lion is just a cub now, and all you need is a mouse-trap.

5.2 The Shakespeare Method

Hold the lion still for a moment (I don't care how you do it), and recite
Shakespeare`s Hamlet to it. The lion will change from 'To be' to
'Not-to-be'.

5.3 The Pentagon method.

Construct a safe, secure cage and leave the door open.  Alternate massive
B-52 strikes across the Sahara desert with subtle propaganda campaigns
emphasizing the safety and security of your cage.  When a lion enters the
cage, close and lock the door.

5.4 The supply-side method.

Distribute vast quantities of lion food and eliminate all threats to the
lion population.  Put a cage in the desert and wait for the explosive
growth of the lion population to force a lion into the cage.

5.5 The Marxist-Leninist method.

Indoctrinate the gazelle population of the Sahara desert in dialectical
materialism.  Disguise your cage as a re-education camp for capitalist
lions, and the gazelles will bring you all the lions you need.

Dear sir,

I strongly object against the Integro-Differential Method[1] . There are
too little lions left on the earth to make this a justifiable method.
Actually, hereby I express my sincere concern against advertising any
method to catch a lion (in the desert or elsewhere) apparently for the sole
reason of catching it.  Also, I question using these methods for any reason
not in the interest of an individual lion's health or not benefitting the
lion as a species.

So said, with best regards,

Dear Drs. van der Sijs,

As regarding your letter of July 5[1], I can assure you that the lion
catching project is completely beneficial.

The original purpose[2,3] was of course just to put some transmitters on
the lions[3], so that their migration patterns could be studied, so that
those regions could be made into national parks, where they would not be
disturbed.  Some scientist just forget the use of projects and just find
new methods and call it ``fundamental science'', aka without any use at
all.  This method[4,1] is clearly not ethical and will not be used in
further experiments.

With kind regards,

The project leader,
Member of WWF.

Several students were asked the following problem:
       Prove that all odd integers higher than 2 are prime.

mathematician: 3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is prime, and by induction, we have
    that all the odd integers are prime."

Statistician: 100% of the sample 5, 13, 37, 41 and 53 is prime, so all odd
    numbers must be prime.

Mechanical Statistician: 3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is prime, 9 is an
    outlier, 11 is prime, 13 is prime, .... all odd numbers are prime.

Measure nontheorist: there are exactly as many odd numbers as primes
	(Euclid, Cantor), and exactly one even prime (namely 2), so
	there must be exactly one odd nonprime (namely 1).

Physicist: 3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is prime, 9 is ... uh, 9 is an
    experimental error, 11 is prime, 13 is prime...  Well, it seems that
    you're right."

Wouldn't a modern physicist employ something like renormalization?
    3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is prime, 9 is ...

    21/3 is prime
Quantum Physicist: All numbers are equally prime and non-prime until observed.

Chemist: "3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is prime.. that's enough."
Chemist: 1 prime, 3 prime, 5 prime...hey, let's publish!

Cosmologist: 3 is prime, yes it is true....

   ASSIGNMENT: Obtain an elephant from Africa.

PHYSICIST: Starting on the west coast, he searches north-
to-south and south-to-north slowly moving east. He
inspects all gray animals keeping the first one that weighs
the same as a known adult elephant plus-or-minus 500 pounds.

MATHEMATICIAN: Starting in the center he moves in an
elliptical spiral (with major axis oriented north-to-south)
removing all non-elephants keeping whatever is left.

EXPERIENCED MATHEMATICAN: Same as unexperienced mathematican, except that
he first tries to proof there is at least one unabiguous elephant before
he starts with the search.

MATHEMATICS PROFESSOR: Same as experienced mathematican, except that he
leaves the actual searching and catching of the elephant to his students.

Other MATHEMATICIANS hunt elephants by going to Africa, throwing out
everything that is not an elephant, and catching one of whatever
is left.

COMPUTER SCIENTIST: First he notes that there are two kinds
of elephants (African and Indian) and requests more
detailed specifications as to which elephant is desired
to be captured. Then he searches east-to-west and west-
to-east starting from the southern tip and moving north.
He stops only when encountering and capturing an animal
whose description matches the American Zoological
Society's classification of the type of elephant he is
seeking.

EXPERIENCED COMPUTER SCIENTIST: Same as inexperienced
computer scientist, except that he places a known
elephant in Cairo to guarantee that the algorithm
terminates.
( The way I teach the insertion sort is to first locate
the smallest element and then to swap it into first place.
Why? So that the insertion algorithm must terminate before
reaching the non-existent zeroth position. I like to tell
this joke just before I teach the insertion sort. -Michael A. Stueben)

ASSEMBLER PROGRAMMER: Same as experienced computer scientist, except
that he prefers to do it on his hand and knees.

SQL PROGRAMMER: Uses the following expression: SELECT elephant FROM Africa.

STATISTICIAN: hunts the first animal he sees n times and calls it elephant.

ECONOMIST: He hunts no elephants, but believes that the elephants would
deliver themselves if payed enough.

ECONOMICAL ADVISER: He hunts no elephants and has never hunted anything at
all. You can hire them by the hour to give good advice.

SYSTEM ANALYSER: Is theoretically capable of calculating the the correlation
between hat size and hit quote, if somebody would tell them what an
elephant is.

1997-03-07	More Smartypants

Here are further observations gleaned from the Project Smartypants
survey (which field has the smartest, or believes it has the
smartest, people?), the results of which were summarized in last
month's mini-AIR.

Astronomer Vinay L. Kashyap:
Speaking of ranking the various disciplines --
Politicians think they are Economists.
Economists think they are Social Scientists.
Social Scientists think they are Psychologists.
Psychologists think they are Biologists.
Biologists think they are Organic Chemists.
Organic Chemists think they are Physical Chemists.
Physical Chemists think they are Physicists.
Physicists think they are Mathematicians.
Mathematicians think they are God.
God ...umm... so happens that God is an Astronomer.

Geographer Wolf Roder:
Back when my daughter was studying at Caltech it was *known* that
astronomers (future) were those who could not make it in physics.

Biochemist Lex Kwee:
Engineering ranks itself pretty high and could beat Physics in a
man to man contest, because they would bring more appropriate
weaponry.

Pam Sexton, who did not identify her field:
I can't say who is smarter, but I did have a physicist boss once
who described chemists as the "lowest form of scientific life".

Astronomer Duncan Steele:
I was once at a seminar about some obscure branch of mathematics.
(Actually I wasn't: I heard about this from someone who may, or
may not, have been there. If it ever actually occurred). The
lecturer drew some bizarre diagram on the board, whereupon a
puzzled member of the audience put up his hand and said that he
couldn't understand which way was up, and which down. The lecturer
replied: "I am from Cambridge: hence all other directions are
down." This proves beyond all reasonable doubt that mathematicians
- at least those from Cambridge - think of themselves as being on
the top of the heap.

Mathematician Fredrik Mansfeld:
I'm a mathematician working as a computer scientist. Since I am of
the purest academic discipline of them all I can assure you that
my opinions are completely objective and unbiased.

 has never been in the lab; polymer chem profs have strange glop
 on their coat, and intro chem profs have acid holes.

Physics Prof: Wears blue jeans and a flannel shirt.  May sometimes
 forget to wear shirt altogether.  If a professor is wearing blue
 jeans and suspenders, ten to one he is a physicist.  Physics profs
 often have German accents, but this is not a distingushing
 characteristic.  Be wary of psychologists with fake Viennese accents
  which can sound similar to the unwary.

Bio Prof: Sometimes wears a lab coat, though usually this is the
 sign of a biochemist.  Marine biologists walk around in hip boots
 for no explainable reason, even in the middle of winter.  They
 are apt to wear grey slacks and smell like fish, as opposed to
 most biologists, who smell strongly of formalin.  Microbiology
 instructors go around in spotless white coats, refuse to drink
 beer on tap, and wipe all their silverware before using it.
 Never loan money to a bio prof, no matter how much he asks.

Psych Prof: Psychologists are not real scientists, and can be
 easily identified by their screams of protest whenever anyone
 questions whether psychology is a science.  Psych people have
 beady little eyes and don't laugh at jokes about psychology.
 If you are not sure whether a person is a scientist or a
 comparative religion instructor, he is probably a psychologist.

CS Prof: Most CS profs are from India or Pakistan.  You can tell
 by the gestures and accents.  This is not a bad thing, though many
 of the American CS professors tend to pick up Indian accents which
 confounds more specific identification.  Like mushrooms, CS students
 only come out at night, and, if not Indian, tend to take on a
 pasty appearance.  CS professors do not use computers and therefore
 can be easily identified by their comparative good health with
 respect to their students.  Many CS professors do not even know how
 to use computers, and are actually mathematicians or psychologists
 in disguise.  Avoid these people.

Math Prof:  Math profs are like physics professors except without
 any practical bent.  A math professor will have only books and
 pencils in his office, as opposed to the piles of broken equipment
 that physicists keep.  Mathematicians scorn the use of computers
 and calculators and often have difficulty splitting bills in
 restaurants.  The easy way to identify a mathematician is by the
 common use of the phrases "It can be shown that..." and "Is left
 as an exercise to the student..."

1997-03-06	Scientist Stereotypes

Investigator Chana Lajcher of the Jerusalem College of Technology
reports on her analysis of science stereotypes:

I worked for a number of years at a large Israeli university science
library (no, I won't mention names). We were usually able to guess the
department of the students coming to the desk by just looking at them:
Young married women, usually pregnant or with a baby in tow, were biology
undergrads. Young males, looking lost, not knowing what book they wanted
(They'd come to the desk saying, "Um, Is this the library? I need the book,
for the course, you know..."), were pharmacology students doing their one
botany course. Elderly library patrons, usually a bit eccentric, were
researchers at the herbarium looking for very rare botany books which they
would discover had been checked out ten years previously by one of their
colleagues (and not yet returned but they promise they'll bring it in the
minute we phone them - if the other reader needs it as much as they
do). Young healthy males, were chemistry undergrads. Students grading
stacks of exams were physics grad students (working part-time as teaching
assistants).  Math was in a different library so I have no stereotypes
(oops I meant data) for them.

no need to make such a great fuss.  So Pete leads him to the dorm.
They enter and Albert is introduced to all of the  present

1999-03-07	Best Wrestlers (1) -- Most Popular

Many and varied are the votes we received for last month's survey
question:

	Of all different kinds of scientists and doctors,
	which make the best professional wrestlers?

Numerous voters, many of whom used only a first name (led by Nick
of Auckland), insisted that proctologists make the best wrestlers.
But for every proctological vote, we received more than two in
favor of a more structurally supportive medical specialty:

"Orthopedists know the easiest ways to break bones."
	-- Michelle Garrison

"As an operating room nurse of many years standing (way too little
sitting!), I nominate orthopedic surgeons due to their ability to
twist and tug."
	-- Sandra Bailey, PhD, RN, CNOR

"Orthopedic Surgeons. No explanation required if you have ever
seen them perform surgery."
	-- Matthew R. Healey

"Orthopaedic surgeons - they tend to be big beefy ex-football
players with few brains."
	-- Mark Pulley

"Orthopedic surgeons, who are allegedly as strong as an ox and
twice as
smart, or was that as smart as an ox and twice as strong?"
	-- Mark Niemer


      ----------------------------------------------------------
1999-03-09	Best Wrestlers (1) -- Cult Favorites

Some voters went against the crowd, insisting on their own
favorites:

"Anthesiologists: Wicked sleeper holds."
	-- Parminder Basran

"A mathematician. Obviously."
	-- Kristina Sontag

"Geomorphologists, because they stay fit through field work
climbing mountains and sand dunes and they are mean because they
get no respect as real scientists."
	-- Linda Lea Jones

"A very large scientist and/or doctor with a chiseled body, a 24
inch vertical leap, really great teeth, and a very, very bad
attitude. Probably a field geologist, because they lug heavy rocks
all over for no apparent reason and so are in the best shape."
	-- Ed Theriot

"My vote is for pediatricians. They get the most on the job
training. Ever try to examine an unhappy 3 year old?"
	-- Sarah Getzler (self-described mother of two
	   and former lab tech)

"Lepidopterists are adept at pinning their subjects to the mat."
	-- Paul Chapin

"Archeologists who work in the field have to do manual labor.
They're probably the strongest scientists on average."
	-- Alan Barksdale

"Psychiatrists. They have the advantage of using psychology to
make the opponent defeat himself. Very little blood is spilled or
violence displayed, because it all happens in the mind!"
	-- Arif Shahabuddin

"Ornithologists, particularly those who specialize in banding
ostriches."
	-- Joanne Cook

	"From prime experience, my largish husband, William Texas
Bradley, neurologist in Fort Worth, Texas, would make the best
professional wrestler type. I may have a master's in English, but
he still provides physical 'airplane rides' which I am unable to
avoid.  (I bet you wonder what THAT means!)"
	-- Baronda E. Bradley

More next month, perhaps.

A man dies and goes to heaven.  Upon his arrival, he looks for an angel
and asks, "Was I a mathematician or an engineer before I came here?"  The
angel ponders the question, and then says, "I wouldn't know...you'd have to
ask God Himself."  So the next day, the man walks up to God and asks his
question again.  God's only response is to hand the man a sheet of paper,
after which he is dismissed.  The man runs back to the same angel, and says,
"God gave me this paper...what does it say?  I can't read it."  The angel
scanned the sheet, and then translated aloud:

Assume:  New arrival was a mathematician in previous plane of existence.

Proof: 1) Said person is currently in heaven.
       2) Therefore... :)

A man dies and goes to heaven. Upon his arrival, he looks for an angel and
asks, "I loved the sea before...could we put in an aquarium here?" The
angel responds, "Sure," and forwards the request to God immediantly. God
sees the request and sets to work, but is quickly stymied. He thinks, "We
need to know the pressure on the surface of the aquarium, but I haven't
seen calculus in so long...We must have a mathematician." One is quickly
called for, and solves the problem with ease. Next, God realizes that the
glass must be able to withstand the pressure, and thinks, "We need a phys-
icist to tell us how much glass is needed." Once again, a physicist is sum-
monned and the problem is quickly solved. However, God now realizes that
there remains the problem of construction, and thinks, "We must have an
engineer." This time however, there is no response to the summons. God
quickly notifies the entrance angel to send any engineers to Him right
away, but to no avail. Finally, after a month he summons the sea-lover to
his chamber and says, "I'm sorry, but we couldn't make the new aquarium."
The man obviously wants to know why, and God replies: "We found a mathe-
matician to figure pressure, we found a physicist to get the glass thick-
ness right, but we couldn't find an engineer in ALL of heaven to put the
thing together!!"

 NancyTorok <ntorok@198.4.75.45>

Here are some interesting interpretations of nature from test papers and
essays submitted to science and health teachers by junior high, high
school, and college students(!) around the world.
Here are some school childrens interpretations of science & school I
found on the net:
(From _Popular Science_ by  way of an Ann Landers column)

- When you breath, you inspire. When you do not breath, you expire.
- H2O is hot water, and CO2 is cold water
- To collect fumes of sulphur, hold a deacon over a flame in a test tube.
- When you smell an odorless gas, it is probably carbon monoxide
- Water is composed of two gins, Oxygin and Hydrogin. Oxygin is pure gin.
  Hydrogin is gin and water.
- Three kinds of blood vessels are arteries, vanes and caterpillars.
- Blood flows down one leg and up the other.
- Respiration is composed of two acts, first inspiration, and then
  expectoration.
- The moon is a planet just like the earth, only it is even deader.
- Artifical insemination is when the farmer does it to the cow instead of
  the bull.
- Dew is formed on leaves when the sun shines down on them and makes them
  perspire.
- A super-saturated solution is one that holds more than it can hold.
- Mushrooms always grow in damp places and so they look like umbrellas.
- The body consists of three parts--the brainium, the borax and the
  abominable cavity. The brainium contains the brain, the borax contains
  the heart and lungs, and the abominable cavity contains the bowels, of
  which there are five - a, e, i, o, and u.
- The pistol of a flower is its only protection against insects.
- The alimentary canal is located in the northern part of Indiana.
- The skeleton is what is left after the insides have been taken out and
  the outsides have been taken off. The purpose of the skeleton is
  something to hitch the meat to.
- A permanent set of teeth consists of eight canines, eight cuspids, two
  molars, and eight cuspidors.
- The tides are a fight between the Earth and moon. All water tends
  towards the moon, because there is no water in the moon, and nature
  abhors a vacuum. I forget where the sun joins in this fight.
- A fossil is an extinct animal. The older it is, the more extinct it is.
- Equator: A menagerie lion running around the Earth through Africa.
- Germinate: To become a naturalized German.
- Liter: A nest of young puppies.
- Magnet: Something you find crawling all over a dead cat.
- Momentum: What you give a person when they are going away.
- Planet: A body of Earth surrounded by sky.
- Rhubarb: A kind of celery gone bloodshot.
- Vacuum: A large, empty space where the pope lives.
- Before giving a blood transfusion, find out if the blood is affirmative
  or negative.
- To remove dust from the eye, pull the eye down over the nose.
- For a nosebleed: Put the nose much lower then the body until the heart
  stops.
- For drowning: Climb on top of the person and move up and down to make
  artifical perspiration.
- For fainting: Rub the person's chest or, if a lady, rub her arm above
  the hand instead. Or put the head between the knees of the nearest
  medical doctor.
- For dog bite: Put the dog away for several days. If he has not
  recovered, then kill it.
- For asphyxiation: Apply artificial respiration until the patient is dead.
- For head cold: Use an agonizer to spray the nose untill it drops in your
  throat.
- To keep milk from turning sour: Keep it in the cow.
- Nitrogen is not found in Ireland because it is not found in a free state.

Talc is found on rocks and on babies.

The law of gravity says no fair jumping up without coming back down.

When they broke open molecules, they found they were only stuffed with

When people run around and around in circles we say they are crazy.
When planets do it we say they are orbiting.

Rainbows are just to look at, not to really understand.

While the earth seems to be knowingly keeping its distance from the sun,

Most books now say our sun is a star.  But it still knows how to change
back into a sun in the daytime.

Water freezes at 32 degrees and boils at 212 degrees.  There are 180

There is a tremendous weight pushing down on the center of the Earth
because of so much population stomping around up there these days.

Lime is a green-tasting rock.

Many dead animals in the past changed to fossils while others preferred

Some oxygen molecules help fires burn while others help make water, so
sometimes it's brother against brother.

Some people can tell what time it is by looking at the sun.  But I have
never been able to make out the numbers.

We say the cause of perfume disappearing is evaporation.  Evaporation
gets blamed for a lot of things people forget to put the top on.

To most people solutions mean finding the answers.  But to chemists
solutions are things that are still all mixed up.

In looking at a drop of water under a microscope, we find there are
twice as many H's as O's.

Clouds are high flying fogs.

I am not sure how clouds get formed.  But the clouds know how to do it,
and that is the important thing.

Clouds just keep circling the earth around and around.  And around.
There is not much else to do.

Water vapor gets together in a cloud.  When it is big enough to be
called a drop, it does.

Humidity is the experience of looking for air and finding water.

We keep track of the humidity in the air so we won't drown when we
breathe.

Rain is often known as soft water, oppositely known as hail.

Rain is saved up in cloud banks.

In some rocks you can find the fossil footprints of fishes.

Cyanide is so poisonous that one drop of it on a dogs tongue will kill
the strongest man.

A blizzard is when it snows sideways.

A hurricane is a breeze of a bigly size.

A monsoon is a French gentleman.

Thunder is a rich source of loudness.

Isotherms and isobars are even more important than their names sound.

It is so hot in some places that the people there have to live in other
places.

The wind is like the air, only pushier.

"Scientists are hypothetical people," wrote a student in chemistry.
The following student comments were gleaned from essays, examinations
and classroom discussions. These beguiling theories are in no way
hypothetical. They are all real and attest to the high level of
scientific literacy in our nation:

* All animals were here before mankind. The animals lived peacefully
until mankind came along and made roads, houses, hotels and condoms.

* Sir Isaac Newton invented gravity.

* The law of gravity says no fair jumping up without coming back down.

* Galileo showed that the earth was round and not vice versa. He
dropped his balls to prove gravity.

* Mare Curie did her research at the Sore Buns Institute in France.

* Men are mammals and women are femammals.

* Proteins are composed of a mean old acid.

* The largest mammals are to be found in the sea because there is
nowhere else to put them.

* Involuntary muscles are not as willing as voluntary ones.

* Methane, a greenhouse gas, comes from the burning of trees and cows.

* The spinal column is a long bunch of bones. The head sits on the top
and you sit on the bottom.

* Water is melted steam.

* A monkey has a reprehensible tail.

* Some people say we condescended from the apes.

* The leopard has black spots which look like round soars on its body.
Those who catch soars get leprosy.

* A cuckoo does not lay its own eggs.

* To remove air from a flask, fill the flask with water, tip the water
out and put the cork in, quick before the air can get back in.

* The three cavities of the body are the head cavity, the tooth cavity
and the abominable cavity.

* Cadavers are dead bodies that have donated themselves to science.
This procedure is called gross anatomy.

* The cause of dew is through the earth revolving on its own axis and
perspiring freely.

* Hot lather comes from volcanoes, when it cools it turns into rocks.

* The earth makes a resolution every 24 hours.

* Parallel lines never meet unless you bend one or both of them.

* Algebra was the wife of Euclid.

* A circle is a figure with o corners and only one side.

* A right angle is 90 degrees Farenhight.

* An example of animal breeding is the farmer who mated a bull that
gave a great deal of milk with a bull with good meat.

* The hydra gets its food by descending upon its prey and pushing it
into its mouth with its testicles.

                            SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION
   Several recent studies have reported that Americans simply aren't
learning much science in school.  That doesn't particularly bother me,
because I know they *are* getting lots of good, reliable scientific
information from a number of places.  Like television, "Newsweek", the
"National Enquirer", cereal boxes, their hairdressers, and so forth.  So
who says science isn't getting across to the public?  Here's some things
people recently have told me they know about science.

I send you some sayings (various definitions and laws) from finishing
exams of high school students.

Second law of thermodynamics.
- The energy of Universe is constant.
- Heat which separates is proportional with product of time, force,
which is needed, and square of velocity.
- Thermodynamics is a thermal phenomenon.
- Thermodynamics is heat, which separates while doing work.

Newton's second law
- The force is proportional with mass which affects and inverse
proportional with it's own mass.
- The force is proportional with mass which affects and inverse
proportional with a square of mass (m^2).
- Two bodies with the same charge can't be friends because they have
always problems conserving the charges.

Work in mechanics.
- The mechanizing and repairing the mechanics is called a work.
- Work in mechanics is this, if the work is made mechanically. It means,
work is made by machine.
- Work in mechanics is that, if a body makes work  and this work
is useful for us.
- Time which is spent in one minute with the same routine moving, is
called work.
- In mechanics the work is the hard or not so hard physical or material
 work. For example, it is needed some kind of hard body to move from
one place to another. For example to the height of one meter. Mechanics will
help us and makes the work.


Bohr's postulates 
- Electricity does not move by circle, but by ellips. 
- In the stacionary postulate the electrons don't radiate, the
determined energy levels do rule.
-1. A meteorite is celestial body which has entered into interstellar space.
 2. All celestial bodies do radiate photons which are flow of particles.
 3. All the planets have the determined stationary state, in which they are.
- All in this nature is in one's own way radiactive.
- Bohr made the experiments with postulates on hydrogen.
- All the bodies are not in the same orbits, so there we might meet
with application of various laws.
- The postulate does not affect other bodies and will always be in
its own orbit.
- In the stationary state the postulate does not radiate.

This is from a Project Gutenberg Etext of 'Literary Blunders', by
Henry Wheatley. I thought that this section in particular deserved a
wider audience.


ACOUSTICS, LIGHT AND HEAT PAPER (1880)
Science and Art Department.


The following are specimens of answers given by candidates at recent
examinations in Acoustics, Light and Heat, held in connection with the
Science and Art Department, South Kensington.  The answers have not of
course all been selected from the same paper, neither have they all
been chosen for the same reason.

Question I.--State the relations existing between the pressure,
temperature, and density of a given gas.  How is it proved that when a
gas expands its temperature is diminished?

Answer.--Now the answer to the first part of this question is, that
the square root of the pressure increases, the square root of the
density decreases, and the absolute temperature remains about the
same; but as to the last part of the question about a gas expanding
when its temperature is diminished, I expect I am intended to say I
don't believe a word of it, for a bladder in front of a fire expands,
but its temperature is not at all diminished.

Question 2.--If you walk on a dry path between two walls a few feet
apart, you hear a musical note or ``ring'' at each footstep.  Whence
comes this?

Answer.--This is similar to phosphorescent paint.  Once any sound gets
between two parallel reflectors or walls, it bounds from one to the
other and never stops for a long time.  Hence it is persistent, and
when you walk between the walls you hear the sounds made by those who
walked there before you.  By following a muffin man down the passage
within a short time you can hear most
distinctly a musical note, or, as it is more properly termed in the
question, a ``ring'' at every (other) step.

Question 3.--What is the reason that the hammers which strike the
strings of a pianoforte are made not to strike the middle of the
strings?  Why are the bass strings loaded with coils of wire?

Answer.--Because the tint of the clang would be bad.  Because to
jockey them heavily.

Question 4.--Explain how to determine the time of vibration of a given
tuning-fork, and state what apparatus you would require for the
purpose.

Answer.--For this determination I should require an accurate watch
beating seconds, and a sensitive ear.  I mount the fork on a suitable
stand, and then, as the second hand of my watch passes the figure 60
on the dial, I draw the bow neatly across one of its prongs.  I wait.
I listen intently.  The throbbing air particles are receiving the
pulsations; the beating prongs are giving up their original force; and
slowly yet surely the sound dies away.  Still I can hear it, but
faintly and with close attention; and now only by pressing the bones
of my head against its prongs.  Finally the last trace disappears.  I
look at the time and leave the room, having determined the time of
vibration of the common ``pitch'' fork.
This process deteriorates the fork considerably, hence a different
operation must be performed on a fork which is only lent.

Question 6.--What is the difference between a ``real'' and a
``virtual'' image?  Give a drawing showing the formation of one of
each kind.

Answer.--You see a real image every morning when you shave.  You do
not see virtual images at all.  The only people who see virtual images
are those people who are not quite right, like Mrs. A.  Virtual images
are things which don't exist.  I can't give you a reliable drawing of
a virtual image, because I never saw one.

Question 8.--How would you disprove, experimentally, the assertion
that white light passing through a piece of coloured glass acquires
colour from the glass?  What is it that really happens?

Answer.--To disprove the assertion (so repeatedly made) that ``white
light passing through a piece of coloured glass acquires colour from
the glass,'' I would ask the gentleman to observe that the glass has
just as much colour after the light has gone through it as it had
before.  That is what would really happen.

Question 11.--Explain why, in order to cook food by boiling, at the
top of a high mountain, you must employ a different method from that
used at the sea level.

Answer.--It is easy to cook food at the sea level by boiling it, but
once you get above the sea level the only plan is to fry it in its own
fat.  It is, in fact, impossible to boil water above the sea level by
any amount of heat.  A different method, therefore, would have to be
employed to boil food at the top of a high mountain, but what that
method is has not yet been discovered.  The future may reveal it to a
daring experimentalist.

Question 12.--State what are the conditions favourable for the
formation of dew.  Describe an instrument for determining the dew
point, and the method of using it.

Answer.--This is easily proved from question 1.  A body of gas as it
ascendsexpands, cools, and deposits moisture; so if you walk up a hill
the body of gas inside you expands, gives its heat to you, and
deposits its moisture in the form of dew or common sweat.  Hence these
are the favourable conditions; and moreover it explains why you get
warm by ascending a hill, in opposition to the well-known law of the
Conservation of Energy.

Question 13.--On freezing water in a glass tube, the tube sometimes
breaks. Why is this?  An iceberg floats with 1,000,000 tons of ice
above the water line.  About how many tons are below the water line?

Answer.--The water breaks the tube because of capallarity.  The
iceberg floats on the top because it is lighter, hence no tons are
below the water line. Another reason is that an iceberg cannot exceed
1,000,000 tons in weight: hence if this much is above water, none is
below.  Ice is exceptional to all other bodies except bismuth.  All
other bodies have 1090 feet below the surface and 2 feet extra for
every degree centigrade. If it were not for this, all fish would die,
and the earth be held in an iron grip.

P.S.--When I say 1090 feet, I mean 1090 feet per second.

Question 14.--If you were to pour a pound of molten lead and a pound
of molten iron, each at the temperature of its melting point, upon two
blocks of ice, which would melt the most ice, and why?

Answer.--This question relates to diathermancy.  Iron is said to be a
diathermanous body (from _dia_, through, and _thermo_, I heat),
meaning that it gets heated through and through, and accordingly
contains a large quantity of real heat. Lead is said to be an
athermanous body (from _a_, privative, and _thermo_, I heat), meaning
that it gets heated secretly or in a latent manner.  Hence the answer
to this question depends on which will get the best of it, the real
heat of the iron or the latent heat of the lead.  Probably the iron
will smite furthest into the ice, as molten iron is white and glowing,
while melted lead is dull.

Question 21.--A hollow indiarubber ball full of air is suspended on
one arm of a balance and weighed in air.  The whole is then covered by
the receiver of an air pump.  Explain what will happen as the air in
the receiver is exhausted.

Answer.--The ball would expand and entirely fill the vessell, driving
out all before it.  The balance being of greater density than the rest
would be the last to go, but in the end its inertia would be overcome
and all would be expelled, and there would
be a perfect vacuum.  The ball would then burst, but you would not be
aware of the fact on account of the loudness of a sound varying with
the density of the place in which it is generated, and not on that in
which it is heard.

Question 27.--Account for the delicate shades of colour sometimes seen
on the inside of an oyster shell.  State and explain the appearance
presented when a beam of light falls upon a sheet of glass on which
very fine equi-distant parallel lines have been scratched very close
to one another.

Answer.--The delicate shades are due to putrefaction; the colours
always show best when the oyster has been a bad one.  Hence they are
considered a defect and are called chromatic aberration.

The scratches on the glass will arrange themselves in rings round the
light, as any one may see at night in a tram car.

Question 29.--Show how the hypothenuse face of a right-angled prism
may be used as a reflector.  What connection is there between the
refractive index of a medium and the angle at which an emergent ray is
totally reflected?

Answer.--Any face of any prism may be used as a reflector.  The
connexion between the refractive index of a medium and the angle at
which an emergent ray does not emerge but is totally reflected is
remarkable and not generally known.

Question 32.--Why do the inhabitants of cold climates eat fat?  How
would you find experimentally the relative quantities of heat given
off when equal weights of sulphur, phosphorus, and carbon are
thoroughly burned?

Answer.--An inhabitant of cold climates (called Frigid Zoans) eats fat
principally because he can't get no lean, also because he wants to
rise is temperature.  But if equal weights of sulphur phosphorus and
carbon are burned in his neighbourhood he will give off eating quite
so much.  The relative quantities of eat given off will depend upon
how much sulphur etc. is burnt and how near it is burned to him. If I
knew these facts it would be an easy sum to find the answer.

1881.

Question 1.--Sound is said to travel about four times as fast in water
as in air.  How has this been proved?  State your reasons for thinking
whether sound travels faster or slower in oil than in water.

Answer(_a_).--Mr. Colladon, a gentleman who happened to have a boat,
wrote to a friend called Mr. Sturm to borrow another boat and row out
on the other side of the lake, first providing himself with a large
ear-trumpet.  Mr. Colladon took a large bell weighing some tons which
he put under water and hit furiously.  Every time he hit the bell he
lit a fusee, and Mr. Sturm looked at his watch.  In this way it was
found out as in the question.

It was also done by Mr. Byott who sang at one end of the water pipes
of Paris, and a friend at the other end (on whom he could rely) heard
the song as if it were a chorus, part coming through the water and
part through the air.

(_b_) This is done by one person going into a hall (? a well) and
making a noise, and another person stays outside and listens where the
sound comes from.  When Miss Beckwith saves life from drowning, her
brother makes a noise under water, and she hearing the sound some time
after can calculate where he is and dives for him; and what Miss
Beckwith can do under water, of course a mathematician can do on dry
land.  Hence this is how it is done.

If oil is poured on the water it checks the sound-waves and puts you
out.

Question 2.--What would happen if two sound-waves exactly alike were
to meet one another in the open air, moving in opposite directions?

Answer.--If the sound-waves which meet in the open air had not come
from the same source they would not recognise each others existence,
but if they had they would embrace and mutually hold fast, in other
words, interfere with and destroy each other.

Question 9.--Describe any way in which the velocity of light has been
measured.

Answer (_a_).--A distinguished but Heathen philosopher, Homer, was the
first to discover this.  He was standing one day at one side of the
earth looking at Jupiter when he conjectured that he would take 16
minutes to get to the other side. This conjecture he then verified by
careful experiment.  Now the whole way across the earth is 3,072,000
miles, and dividing this by 16 we get the velocity 192,000 miles a
second.  This is so great that it would take an express train 40 years
to do it, and the bullet from a canon over 5000 years.

P.S.--I think the gentlemans name was Romer not Homer, but anyway he
was 20% wrong and Mr. Fahrenheit and Mr. Celsius afterwards made more
careful determinations.

(_b_) An Atheistic Scientist (falsely so called) tried experiments on
the Satellites of Jupiter.  He found that he could delay the eclipse
16 minutes by going to the other side of the earths orbit;  in fact he
found he could make the eclipse happen when he liked by simply
shifting his position.  Finding that credit was given him for
determining the velocity of light by this means he repeated it
so often that the calendar began to get seriously wrong and there were
riots, and Pope Gregory had to set things right.

Question 10.--Explain why water pipes burst in cold weather.

Answer.--People who have not studied Acoustics think that Thor bursts
the pipes, but we know that it is nothing of the kind for Professor
Tyndall has burst the mythologies and has taught us that it is the
natural behaviour of water (and bismuth)
without which all fish would die and the earth be held in an iron
grip.

                            A Daughter's Letter

Dear Mother and Dad,

It has now been three months since I left for college. I have been remiss
in writing and I am very sorry for the thoughtlessness in not having
written before. I will bring you up-to-date now, but before you read on,
please sit down. You are not going to read any further unless you are
sitting down. Okay?

Well, I am getting along pretty well now. The skull fracture and the
concussion I got when I jumped out of the window of my dormitory when it
caught fire shortly after my arrival are pretty well healed now. I only
spent two weeks in the hospital, and now I can see almost normally and only
get those sick headaches one a day.

Fortunately, the fire in the dormitory and my jump were witnessed by an
attendant at the gas station near the dorm, and he was the one who called
the Fire Department and the ambulance.

He also visited me in the hospital and since I had nowhere to live because
of the burnt out dormitory, he was kind enough to invite me to share his
apartment with him. Its really a basement room, but its kind of cute. He is
a very fine boy and we have fallen deeply in love and are planning to get
married. We haven't set the exact date yet, but it will be before my
pregnancy begins to show.

Yes, Mother and Dad, I am pregnant. I know how much you are looking forward
to being grandparents and I know you will welcome the baby and give it the
same love and devotion and tender care you gave me when I was a child.

The reason for the delay in our marriage is that my boyfriend has some
minor infection which prevents us from passing the pre-marital blood test
and I carelessly caught it from him. This will clear up with the penicillin
injections I am now taking daily. I know you will welcome him into the
family with open arms. He is kind and although not well educated, he is
ambitious. Although he is of a different race and religion than ours, I
know your often expressed tolerance will not permit you to be bothered by
the fact that his skin color is somewhat different than ours. I am sure
that you will love him as I do. His family background is good too, for I am
told that his father is an important engineer for the sanitation department
he works for.  Although they say he runs his office from his truck.

Now that I have brought you up-to-date, folks, I want to tell you that
there was NO dormitory fire, I did not have a concussion or a skull
fracture, I was not in the hospital, I am not pregnant, I am not engaged, I
do not have syphilis, and there is no schwartze in my life. However, I am
getting a "D" in history and an "F" in science, and I wanted you to see
those marks in the proper perspective.

                           SCIENTISTS EXPLAINED

People who work in the fields of science and engineering are not like other
people. This can be frustrating to the non-technical people who have to
deal with them. The secret to coping with technology-oriented people is to
understand their motivations. The following analysis will teach you
everything you need to know. Their customs and mannerisms were learnt by
observing them, much the same way Jane Goodall learnt about the great apes,
but without the hassles of grooming.

********************************

1. SCIENTIST IDENTIFICATION KIT

Science is so trendy these days that everyone wants to be one. the word
'scientist' is greatly overused. If there's somebody in your life who you
think is trying to pass as a scientist, give him/her this test to discern
the truth:

You walk into a room and notice that a picture is hanging crooked. You...

A. Straighten it.

B. Ignore it.

C. Buy a CAD system and spend the next six months designing a solar-powered,
self-adjusting picture frame while often stating aloud your belief that the
inventor of the nail was a total moron.

The correct answer is "C" but partial credit can be given to anybody who
writes "it depends" in the margin of the test or who simply blames the whole
stupid thing on "marketing".

2. SOCIAL SKILLS

Scientists have different objectives when it comes to social interaction.

"Normal" people expect to accomplish several unrealistic things from social
interaction:

* Stimulating and thought provoking conversation;
* Important social contacts;
* A feeling of connectedness with other humans.

In contrast to "normal" people, scientists have rational objectives for
social interactions:

* Get it over with as soon as possible;
* Avoid getting invited to something unpleasant;
* Demonstrate mental superiority and mastery of all subjects.

3. FASCINATION WITH GADGETS

To the scientist, all matter in the universe can be placed into one of two
catagories: (1) things that need to be fixed, and (2) things that will need
to be fixed after you've had a few minutes to play with them.

Scientists like to solve problems. If there are no problems handily
available, they will create their own. "Normal" people don't understand this
concept, they believe that if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Scientists
believe that if it ain't broke, it doesn't have enough features yet.

No scientist looks at a TV remote control without wondering what it would
take to turn it into a stun gun. No scientist can take a shower without
wondering if some sort of Teflon coating would make showering unnecessary.

To the scientist, the world is a toy box full of sub-optimized and
feature-poor toys.

4. FASHION AND APPEARANCE

Clothes are the lowest priority for a scientist, assuming the basic
thresholds for temperature and decency have been satisfied. If no appendages
are freezing or sticking together, and no genitalia or mammary glands are
swinging around in plain view, then the objective of clothing has been met.

5. LOVE OF "STAR TREK"

Scientists love all of the Star Trek TV shows and movies. It's a small
wonder, since the scientists on the USS Enterprise are portrayed as heroes,
occasionally even having sex with aliens. this is much more glamorous than
the life of a real scientist, which consists of hiding from the Universe and
having sex without the participation of any other life forms.

6. DATING AND SOCIAL LIFE

Dating is never easy for scientists. A "normal" person will employ various
indirect and duplicitous methods to create a false impression of
attractiveness. Scientists are incapable of placing appearance above function.

Fortunately, scientists have an ace in the hole. They are widely recognised
as superior marriage material: intelligent, dependable, employed, honest,
and handy around the house. While it's true that most "normal" people would
prefer note to date a scientist, most normal people harbour an intense
desire to mate with them, thus producing scientist-like children who will
have high-paying jobs long before losing their virginity.

Male scientists reach their peak of sexual attractiveness later than most
"normal" men, becoming irresistable erotic dynamos in their mid-thirties to
late forties. Just look at these examples of sexually irresistable men in
technical professions:

* Bill Gates
* MacGyver

Female scientists become irresistable at the age of consent and remain that
way until about thirty minutes after their clinical death. Longer if it's a
warm day.

7. HONESTY

Scientists are always honest in matters of technology and human
relationships. That's why it's a good idea to keep scientists away from
customers, romantic interests and other people who can't handle the truth.

Scientists sometimes bend the truth to avoid work. They say things that
sound like lies but technically are not because nobody could be expected to
believe them. The complete list of scientist lies is stated below:

 "I won't change anything without asking you first."
 "I'll return your hard-to-find cable tomorrow."
 "I have to have new equipment to do my job/research."
 "I'm not jealous of your new computer."

8. FRUGALITY

Scientists are notoriously frugal. This is not because of cheapness or mean
spirit; it is simply because every spending situation is simply a problem
in optimization, that is, "How can I escape this situation while retaining
the greatest amount of cash?"

9. POWERS OF CONCENTRATION

If there is one trait that best defines a scientist, it is the ability to
concentrate on one subject to the complete exclusion of everything else in
the environment.

This sometimes causes scientists to be pronounced dead prematurely. Some
funeral homes in high tech areas have started checking resumes before
processing the bodies. Anybody with a B.Sc. or experience in computer
programming is propped up in a lounge for a few days just to see if he or
she snaps out of it.

10. RISK

Scientists hate risk. They try to eliminate it whenever they can. This is
understandable, given that when a scientist makes a mistake, the media will
treat it like it's a big deal or something.

Examples of Bad Press for Scientists:

* Hindenburg
* Challenger
* SPANet (tm)
* Hubble Space Telescope
* Apollo 13
* Titanic
* Ford Pinto

The risk/reward calculation for scientists looks something like this:

RISK: Public humiliation and the death of thousands of innocent people.
REWARD: A certificate of appreciation in a handsome plastic frame.

Being practical people, scientists evaluate this balance of risks and
rewards and decide that risk is not a good thing. The best way to avoid
risk is by advising that any activity is technically impossible for reasons
that are far too complicated to explain.

If that approach is not sufficient to halt a project, then the scientist
will fall back to a second line of defense: "It's technically possible but
it will cost too much."

11. EGO

Ego-wise, two things are important to scientists:

* How smart they are;
* How many cool devices they own.

The fastest way to get a scientist to solve a problem is to declare that
the problem is unsolvable. No scientist can walk away from an unsolvable
problem until it's solved. No illness or distraction is sufficient to get
the scientist off the case. These types of challenges quickly become
personal - a battle between the scientist and the laws of nature.

Scientists will go without food and hygiene for days to solve a problem
(other times just because they forgot). And when they succeed in solving
the problem they will experience an ego rush that is better than sex - and
we're including the kind of sex where other people are involved.

othing is more threatening to the scientist than the suggestion that
somebody else has more technical skill. "Normal" people sometimes use that
knowledge as a lever to extract more work from the scientist.

When a scientist says that something can't be done (a code phrase that
means it's not fun to do), some clever "normal" people have learnt to
glance at the scientist with a look of compassion and pity, and say
something along these lines: "I'll ask Bob to figure it out. He knows how
to solve difficult problems."

At that point it is a good idea for the "normal" person to not stand
between the scientist and the problem. The scientist will set upon the
problem like a starved chihuahua on a pork chop.

Sample recommendation letter:
Dear Search Committee Chair,
I am writing this letter for Mr. John Smith who has applied for a position
in your department. I should start by saying that I cannot recommend him
too highly.
In fact, there is no other student with whom I can adequately compare him,
and I am sure that the amount of mathematics he knows will surprise you.
His dissertation is the sort of work you don't expect to see these days. It
definitely demonstrates his complete capabilities.
In closing, let me say that you will be fortunate if you can get him to
work for you.

Sincerely,
A. D. Visor (Prof.)

     I agree that The Bay is a very special company for Canada for its
     long and "colourful" history, but I *think* it's a youngster in
     comparison to certain European companies (although I couldn't name
     one).  I remember hearing a story of an American company
     negotiating a business deal with a Swedish steel company.  In the
     proposition sent to Europe, the American company mentioned some
     reliability concerns and asked for proof that they could count on
     the Swedish company still being there in a year.  In a terse
     letter, the Swedish firm replied that since they had existed more
     than four times the age of the USA, they didn't see why they would
     not be there the next year...

Comparable anecdote #1:  At the 350th anniversary celebrations of
Harvard University, one speaker said, "Harvard is intimately bound up
with the history and culture of the United States -- an innovation in
which we have taken considerable interest."

Comparable anecdote #2:  Someone has calculated that there are in
Europe 26 (this number is my best recollection of what was said)
organizations that have been in continuous existence for at least five
hundred years:  the Parliament at Westminster, the Althing (parliament)
of Iceland, the Roman Catholic Church, and 23 universities.

Anecdote #3, told by Greg Benford:  At an Oxford college, they were
debating what to do with all their money.  The consensus was to buy
land, since "for the past thousand years, land has proven to be a very
wise investment for the college."

The crusty old patriarch piped in, "True, but the past thousand years
have been atypical."

                   RENEWABLE AND NON-RENEWABLE RESOURCES

My two favourite anecdotes on this subject demonstrate the difference
between renewable and non-renewable resources.  First the non-renewable:

The congregation of a small stone church (in England?)  decided that
the stone which formed the step up to the front door had become two
worn by its years of use, and would have to be replaced.  Unfortunately,
there were hardly any funds available for the replacement.  Then
someone came up with the bright idea that the replacement could be
postponed for many years by simply turning the block of stone over.

They discovered that their great-grandparents had beaten them to it.

            ------------------------------------------------


Now the renewable:

An entomologist at New College, Oxford ("New" because its only a few
centuries old), discovered beetles infesting the oak beams supporting
the roof of the Great Hall.  It was fairly urgent that these be
replaced before the roof collapsed -- but anyone who has looked at the
price of oak lately can tell you that this was not something the
college budget was prepared for.

Since oak from a commercial supplier was out of the question, someone
suggested that the college Forester be sent for.  His job was to
administer the various scattered tracts of land that had been deeded to
the college when it was founded.  The trustees hoped he might know of
suitable trees on college land.

It turned out that there was indeed a suitable stand of mighty oaks.
They had been planted when the college was founded, and down the
centuries each Forester had told his successor:  "You don't cut those
oaks; those are for when the beetles get into the beams in the Main
Hall."

Top ten ways the Bible would be different if it were written by college
students

10. Last Supper would have been eaten the next morning - cold.
 9. The Ten Commandments are actually only five, double-spaced, and
    written in a large font.
 8. New edition every two years in order to limit reselling.
 7. Forbidden fruit would have been eaten because it wasn't cafeteria
    food.
 6. Paul's letter to the Romans becomes Paul's e-mail to abuse@romans.gov.
 5. Reason Cain killed Abel: They were roommates.
 4. The place where the end of the world occurs: Finals, not Armageddon.
 3. Out go the mules, in come the mountain bikes
 2. Reason why Moses and followers walked in desert for 40 years:  They
    didn't want to ask directions and look like Freshmen.
 1. Instead of God creating the world in six days and resting on the
    seventh, He would have put it off until the night before it was due
    and then pulled an all-nighter.

Reminds me of Raymond Smullyan's definitions of "obvious," according to
various professors at a certain unnamed university (paraphrased from memory
from WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS BOOK):

Here, if Professor A says something is obvious, it means that if you go
home and think about it for the rest of the afternoon, you will probably
see that it is true.

If Professor L says something is obvious, it means that if you go off and
spend the rest of your life considering it, the day might eventually come
when you see that it is true.

If Professor W says something is obvious, it means that the class has known
about it for the last two weeks.

If Professor F says something is obvious, it means that it is probably
false.

He telleth me more than I can write.
He lowreth mine grades.
Yea, though I walk through the corridors of knowledge,

He tryeth to teach me.
He writeth equations before me in hopes that I will

1997-04-05	Advice for Researchers

Here are some useful bits of advice for researchers. They were
devised or plagiarized by three of AIR's most experienced
editorial board members.

>From Earle Spamer, Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia:
1.	Stare out a window frequently;
        it inspires thoughtfulness among others.
2.	Doze only when looking through a microscope;
        no one will know.
3.	Lend only dry pens to those who ask to borrow one;
        eventually, they will leave you alone altogether.
4.	Fungal colonies in coffee cups DO constitute
        science experiments.
5.	Start practicing now to write the date with "2000"
        for the year.
6.	Young researchers should practice their
        Nobel acceptance speeches early in their careers;
        but leave the subject area blank for now.
7.	Always keep a tie in your desk for emergencies
        (this applies to men, mostly).
8.	Don't keep a stethoscope in your white lab coat pocket
        unless you are actually in the medical profession.
9.	Smile a lot; it makes others nervous.

>From Wendy Cooper, Australian National University, Canberra:
1.	Alwys use teh speling cheker.
2.	Don't take naps in the lab.
3.	Wear nothing under your lab coat.
4.	Be nice to experimental animals -- nobody has been able
        to disprove reincarnation.

>From Leonard Finegold, Drexel University, Philadelphia:
1.	My mother used to tell me to never repeat an experiment
        (lest I get a different result).

A:  None. They use them as controls in double blind trials.

Q:  How many academics does it take to change a lightbulb ?
A:  None. That is what their students are for.  (from Philip Clarke in New
    Scientist)

A:  Five: One to write the grant proposal, one to do the mathematical
    modelling, one to type the research paper, one to submit the paper for
    publishing, and one to hire a student to do the work.

Q:  How many laboratory heads (senior researchers, etc.) does it take to
    change a lightbulb?
A:  Five; one to change the lightbulb, the other four to stand around
    arguing whether he/she is taking the right approach.

Q:  How many research technicians does it take to change a lightbulb?
A:  One, but it'll probably take him/her three or four tries to get it right.

Q:  How many post-doctoral fellows does it take to change a lightbulb?
A:  One, but it'll probably take three or four tries to get it right because
    he/she will probably give it to the technician to do.

Q:  How many graduate students does it take to screw in a light bulb?
A:  Only one, but it may take upwards of five years for him to get it done.
A:  It all depends on the size of the grant.
A:  Two and a professor to take credit.
A:  1/100. A graduate student needs to change 100 lightbulbs a day.
A:  I don't know, but make my stipend tax-free, give my advisor a
    $100,000 grant of the taxpayer's money, and I'm sure he can tell me
    how to do the work for him so he can take the credit for answering this
    incredibly vital question.

Why God Never Received Tenure from Any University

1. He had only one major publication
2. It was in Hebrew and Greek.
3. It had no references
4. It wasn't published in a refereed journal
5. Some doubt He wrote it Himself
6. He may have created the world, but what has he done since?
7. The scientific community can't replicate His results
8. He never got permission from the ethics board to use human subjects
9. When one experiment went awry, He tried to cover it up by drowning the
   subjects
10. He rarely came to class and just told students to "Read the Book"
11. Some say He had His son teach the class
12. He expelled His first two students for learning.
13. His office hours were irregular and sometimes held on a mountaintop.
14. Although there were only 10 requirements, most students failed
15. His cooperative efforts have been quite limited.
16. When subjects didn't behave as predicted, he deleted them from the

                 SURVIVOR'S GUIDE TO A LIFE (?) IN SCIENCE

You've just finished another aruous week in the lab and you'v nothing to
show for it.  Your phospo-proteins aren't, you used DNase when RNasing your
plasmid prep, you knocked out three of you colleagues when etherizing your
rats and you somehow managed to develop a new protocol for the productions
of trinitro-toluene.  You've pretty much reached wits end and you're ready
to quit.
Well, we at *Aliquotes* have decided to give you the following suggestions
to help you cope with weeks like these and remind you that life is good.

1.  Buck up, chum.  Life is okay and you just have to remind yourself that
you'r pretty darn special.  (This one hardly ever works and your friends
start to get really worried about you.  Beware of men carrying the white
coats with really long sleeves.)

2.  Talk to some of your colleagues or your supervisor and see if you can't
troubleshoot the problems, coming up with a solution which will be
beneficial to all.  (This one is rarely followed as it requires the
scientist to own up to the fact that there is a problem in the first
place.  It's bad enough that you feel terrible, but to look stupid in your
department would be just too much to bear.)

3.  Lower your standards for success.  Congratulations, you've been able to
get a mole of NaCl to dissolve in a litre of water and the pH meter said
that the pH4 standard had a pH of four!  (This one is good, but tends to
only last a little while before the pH meter starts to give you trouble and
you realize that you need more than 1M NaCl to finish your experiments.)

4.  Go find someone else in the department who is having a worse time than
you are and revel in the fact that it could be worse.  Try not to gloat
though as that is just crass.  (This is a pretty good one and will give you
some satisfaction for a week or so, but the joy tends to wear thin as you
begin to empathize with the individual and can no longer take joy from
their misfortune.  Also there is the serious risk that there is no one in
worse shape than you and everyone else is coming to your bench.)

5.  Visit a factory where people work at jobs requiring excessive and
strenuous effort or are involved in the endless tedium of punch cards and
paper pushing.  (This tends to scare people into submission and should only
be attempted under the most extreme cases.)

6.  Take a look at you C.V. and you will quickly realize that you are not
acually suited to any other form of employment.  (This one tends to only
depress people further as they realize that they are trapped and their only
other choice involves the expression, "Do you want fries with that?".)

7.  Go to the local drinking establishment and run up a tab which
challenges your student loans.  (This is clearly the most popular method
for dealing with stress.  The one draw back is that you walk in on Monday
morning with a large woolen sock around your tongue and the ability to
sense every corpuscle wich passes through the capillaries under the skin
of your scalp, but hey, you had a good weekend.)

Dear Fellow Scientist:

This letter has been around the world at least seven times.  It has
been to many major conferences.  Now it has come to you.  It will
bring you good fortune.  This is true even if you don't believe it.
But you must follow these instructions:

 -  include in your next journal article the citations below.
 -  remove the first citation from the list and add a
    citation to your journal article at the bottom.
 -  make ten copies and send them to colleagues.

Within one year, you will be cited up to 10,000 times!  This will
amaze your fellow faculty, assure your promotion and improve your
sex life.  In addition, you will bring joy to many colleagues. Do
not break the reference loop, but send this letter on today.

Dr. H. received this letter and within a year after passing it on
she was elected to the National Academy of Sciences.  Prof. M.
threw this letter away and was denied tenure.  In Japan, Dr. I.
received this letter and put it aside.  His article for Trans.
on Nephrology was rejected.  He found the letter and passed it on,
and his article was published that year in the New England Journal
of Medicine.  In the Midwest, Prof. K. failed to pass on the letter,
and in a budget cutback his entire department was eliminated.  This
could happen to you if you break the chain of citations.

                             WRITE THESIS FAST
This letter was first written by a graduate student in Europe in 1954
and has traveled around the world at least 16 times.  At first I
wouldn't believe that it would work, but after trying it, I am now a
believer in its mystical and magical power.

This letter was received by a graduate student in Chicago, IL in 1973
and within two weeks, he had completed a 5600 page doctoral
dissertation and began a career which lead to a Nobel Prize.  A few
years later, another graduate student received this letter and sent it
to 5 of her friends, and she too completed a 3100 page paper which has
continued to grow to this day!

Simply write five pages of text on the given subjects for each person
on this list.  Than place your name in slot #1 and move everyone else's
name down one space.  Send this letter to ten of your colleagues, and
within a month, you too will have a thesis or disertation which your
advisor can choke on if he or she doesn't go blind or break his or her
back first.

The last person who received this letter and did not respond was
tormented by receiving 100-level teaching assignments until he was 40
years old.  Today he works as a clerk for the Little-Plastic-Pizza-Table
Museum in Cleveland, OH, making minimum wage and regretting his
terrible decision not to perpetuate this letter.

Consider the following:

You never actually see Santa, only his "assistants".
Santa keeps his job until he decides to retire.
Santa doesn't really do the work; he directs a bunch of helpers to do
all his work for him, but he's the one who everybody credits with the
work.
Santa doesn't work anywhere near a 40 hour week.
Santa travels a lot.

Yup, Santa is obviously a senior faculty member with tenure!

Your I.Q. goes up forty points. You now understand chapter four of
your chemistry assignment. Dave is still here.

the lab. You are thirsty.

  You have an instant hangover. You can't stand up. Dave mutters
something about being left out.

  There is some aspirin here.

  YUCK! You munch it up. You begin to feel better.

  You can't. Your keys are in the room.

  You open the nearest door without knocking. Charles and Anna are
here. Dave is here. There are clothes on the floor. There are no
clothes on Charles and Anna. You get the feeling you should leave.

You are back in the hall. You are hungry.

  You come to a lounge.
  There is a door here.

  You aren't even vaguely hungry. In fact, the concept of
introducing this swill into your system is bletcherous.

  You are in a quad.
> smoke weed
  You now have the munchies. Your subjective I.Q. increases by 10
points. You have a revelation involving the cosmic significance of
Spam.

munchables.

  You need a tray first.

  You now have the Tray of Cafeteria Browninan Motion.

  You serve yourself a generous portion of cafeteria yumness. You
take a seat and begin shoveling it into your face. After two bites
you are full. You have food poisoning.

  You can't. The cafeteria is cursed. You still have food
poisoning.

  A small sip is probably sufficient to kill all the residents of
Hong Kong and render it uninhabitable until the lease runs out.

  You feel the potent brew coursing down your digestive tract,
killing everything in its path. You no longer have food poisoning.
You pass out. After two hours, you wake up.
  You are in a quad.

  You goof up.

  You finally manage to open the box. Inside there are eight flyers
for college events that happened three weeks ago. A ninth is
current - an invitation to play croquet with the provost. You
decline and roundfile the sheaf. There is a package notice here.
There is a letter here.
> read letter
  You open the letter. It is a long steamy graphic explicit love
letter... from a total stranger.
> check address
  Both the package notice and the opened letter are for your
boxmate. They are postdated three months ago. You have been
airboxed.

  You are hemmed in by 1000 dorm androids sans brassieres trying to
get to their boxes.

  Your howling causes the androids to stare at the sky in
confusion, giving you time to make your escape.
> north
  You exit stage left, kicking several fembots in the shins as you
pass. The bit of abuse you inflict causes several of the fembots to
follow you, hoping for more.
  There is a very small grove of trees to the east.

  You are standing in the quad again. The smell of sweat socks
fills the air. The cafeteria is preparing dinner.
There are some fembots here.
There are some shattered sweat socks here.
There is a small red bottle that says "Drink Me!" here.
There is a book of matches here.
There is a lamp post here. There is a notice pinned to the
lamppost.
> Get matches.
Taken.

  Don't you want to see what it says first?

  There are many trees nearby.

  You must first light a match.
> light match
  The match refuses to burn.
> drop match
  You violate the ecological pristiness of the area by dropping a
filthy, unnatural, manmade piece of trash on the ground. One of the
fembots gets offended and leaves to organize a protest.

  The second match bursts into flame.
> burn notice
  The notice burns with a pleasant green flame.

  You take the bottle that says "Drink Me!"

  You walk to a deserted area between two buildings. There is a
north-south path here.
There are some fembots here.
There are some protesters here.
Your fingers are getting warm.

  You walk north. The path winds around to the east. There is a
building to the north.
  There are some fembots here.
  There is some chanting coming from the south.
  Your fingers are burning.
> Drop match
  You drop the match on the ground. Your fingers continue to burn.
> Suck on fingers
  The fembots are offended by the sexual symbolism and leave.
  The fire is extinguished. Your fingers are throbbing now.
  There is a match burning on the ground.
> step on match
  You step on the match, burning the bottom of your foot in the
process. You should remember to wear shoes more often.
  There is a burnt-out match sitting on the ground.
> wear shoes
  You move very quietly now.
> north
  You smack your head into the building. The building does not
move.
  Your I.Q. drops by 10 points. You no longer grok spam.
> east
  You enter the Merrill academic building. You are in a North-South
hallway. There is a door to the East. Exit is to the West.
> east
  You enter a quiet classroom. The students, who had apparently
been taking an exam, look up at you angrily. The professor glares
at you angrily. The students return to their frantic efforts. The
professor, who looks vaguely familiar, continues to glare. You
suddenly realize that this is your calculus class, which you have
not attended in three weeks.
> sit
  You find an empty desk. The chair squeaks as you seat yourself,
causing the student next to you to give you a grimace that would
make a good Butthole Surfers album cover. The professor brings you
a copy of the midterm.
> look test
  You look at the test. The problems on the first page are
impossible. The material on the following eight pages is worse.
Test stress causes your I.Q. to drop 100 points.
> do test
  This is impossible, as you have neither pencil nor calculator.
You realize that failing this exam means failing the course.
> borrow pencil
  Your neighbor growls angrily as soon as you start to vocalize
your request.
> steal pencil
  You steal the extra pencil from your neighbor's desk. He does not
notice.
> do test
  You start to work on the first problem, even though you have only
a vague understanding of how to solve it. The pencil hurts your
charred fingers. Beads of sweat form on your forehead as you
scratch out calculations that would normally be done on a
calculator. You reach an answer that could not possibly be correct.
> do second problem
  Just reading the second problem severely stresses your mental
resources. You suffer a brain embolism.
> do problem
  You begin calculations on the second problem. Sweat begins to
trickle from your face and armpits. You begin to stink. The trickle
of sweat turns into a raging torrent. Your brain seizes. You cannot
move.
> wait
  Time passes...
> wait
  Time passes...
> wait
  Time passes. You can move now.
> smoke test
  Do you really want to do that?
> smoke test
  As you inhale the xeroxed papyrus, you feel the knowledge of the
ancients seeping into your mind. You come to a complete
understanding of the material, but you no longer have anything to
turn in.
> write answers
  What do you want to write the answers on?
> paper
  You start scribbling the solutions to the problems on the blank
papers of zig-zag. Just as you write the last answer, the teacher
collects the exams, staples them together, and leaves. You have
truly smoked this test.
> east
  You are in a north-south hallway. There is a door to the east.
> north
  You stumble down the hallway in a northerly direction. Smacking
into the door at the end and popping it open. You trip over your
untied shoelaces and fall through the doorway. The door slams shut
behind you.
> Tie shoelaces
  You tie your shoelaces into a very tight knot. Your shoes can now
only be removed by surgery.

              Weekly Work Reports and the Moshinsky Maneuver

This is a true story, as told by my father, whose sister worked in the
ININ. It is called "The Moshinsky Maneuver":

At one point, in Mexico's National Institute of Nuclear Research (ININ),
instead of appointing a scientist as head of the Institute (as was
traditional), the president appointed an administrator.  The new Director
promptly enacted all sorts of administrative procedures and forms that had
to be filled by every department.  In particular, he announced that every
Department Head had to file a weekly Activities Report, and a weekly
"Projected Activities for the Coming Week" report, both to be delivered
during a weekly Department Head meeting with the Director.

Dr. Marcos Moshinsky was then the head of the Theoretical Physics
Department. This is how he dealt with the announcement:

At the first weekly meeting, the Theoretical Physics Dept.  presented the
following report:

"During the past week, the Theoretical Physics Dept. worked
 on solving the following differential equations:" and then followed two
pages of hand-written differential equations.

"During the coming week, the Theoretical Physics Dept. hopes
 to solve the following differential equations:"
and then followed three pages of hand-written differential
equations.

The Head of the Institute announced the next morning that the Theoretical
Physics Dept. was excused from the weekly meetings, and could present only
one report every six months.

Third Year Noticeboard.

!--------

Friday, May 4, 1990.

Just a friendly reminder.  Please note that the last date for the
submission of continuous assessment essays is Friday May 18 1990.
Your essays should be handed to Maureen in the departmental
office on or before that day and a receipt obtained.

Friday, May 18, 1990.

It rather looks as though some third year students have not yet
handed in their continuous assessment essays to Maureen in the
departmental office.  The FINAL deadline for the submission of
these essays is TUESDAY MAY 22.

Generic Lecturer (Prof)

!--------

Tuesday, May 22, 1990.

One or two third year students have still not handed in their
continuous assessment essays to Maureen in the departmental
office.  The ABSOLUTE AND FINAL deadline for submission of these
essays is FRIDAY MAY 25.  You are advised that failure to submit
by this date may have implications for your final mark.

G. Lecturer (Professor)

!--------

Friday, May 25, 1990.

Listen.  You lot really are pushing your luck this year. I know
that some of you are relying on the soft-hearted liberals and
pusillanimous social workers in the department to vote down any
system of penalizing late submissions but you should note that we
failed to get a draconian punishment system through by only one
vote last year and that means with our new and highly
authoritarian external examiner on the committee this year you
could be in for a very nasty shock indeed. (How about THREE marks
off your total for every day late?  What d'you think of that, eh?)
So this is your ABSOLUTE AND FINAL AND ULTIMATE LAST CHANCE.
Unless you get those bleeding essays in to Maureen by Monday
morning May 28 at 9.30am, I will do my damnedest to ensure that
there'll be no reason whatsoever for YOUR mother to show up on
this campus on Graduation Day.
GET MY DRIFT?

                        TIPS FOR SURVIVING COLLEGE

* Minimize food budget by scheduling classes around Happy Hour.

* Enjoy being a Sophomore -- It will be the best three years of your life.

* Wear an athletic cup to panty raids, because it's all fun and games until
someone loses their 'nads.

* Lemon juice and baking soda make an excellent bong water stain remover.

* Earn extra cash by parlaying chemistry knowledge into lucrative "home
pharmaceuticals" business.

* If an 8:00 am class is required for your major, change your major.

* Boring lecture? Start a wave!

* College-level algebra: 5 returnable bottles = 1 delicious Ramen Noodle
dinner.

* "I Phelta Thi" is *not* a real fraternity, except at state colleges.

* Remember - almost no one complains when you puke in a dumpster.

* Clever margin manipulation can turn a 4-page outline into a 100-page
senior essay.

* Football games were never meant to be observed by sober people.

* Don't think of it as sleeping with your professor -- think of it as
"acing Biology."

* In a pinch, milk can be used as a beer substitute in your breakfast
cereal.

                          HIGH SCHOOL VS. COLLEGE

* In high school, you do homework. In college, you study.

* No food is allowed in the hall in high school. In college, food must be
provided at an event before students will come.

* In high school, you wear your backpack on one shoulder; in college, on
both.

* In college, the professors can tell you the answer without looking at the
teacher's guide.

* In college, there are no bells or tardy slips.

* In high school, you have to live with your parents. In college, you get to
live with your friends.

* In college, you don't have to wait in a certain lunch line to be cool.

* Only nerds e-mailed in high school. Cool kids hadn't heard of it.

* In high school, you're told what classes to take. In college, you get to
choose; that is, as long as the classes don't conflict and you have the
prerequisites and the classes aren't closed and you've paid your tuition.

* In high school, if you screw up you can usually sweet-talk your way out of
it. In college, you're lucky to ever talk with the professor.

* In high school, fire drills are planned by the administration; in college,
by the drunk frat boys on their way home when the bars close.

* In college, any test consists of a larger percentage of your grade than
your high school final exams ever did.

* In high school, when the teacher said, "Good morning," you mumbled back.
In college, when the professor says, "Good morning," you write it down.

* In high school, freshman guys hit on senior girls. In college, senior guys
hit on freshman girls.

* In college, weekends start on Thursday.

* In college, it's much more difficult to figure out the course schedule of
the man/woman you have a crush on, in order to figure out where he/she will
be walking around campus and at what time to find them there.

* Once you've obtained the information described in #10, it's much more
time-consuming to run between classes to that place where you know he/she
will be in order to "just happen to bump into him/her."

* In college, there's no one to tell you not to eat pizza three meals a day.

* In college, your dad doesn't pay for dates.

* In high school, it never took 3 or 4 weeks to get money from Mom and Dad.

* College men are cuter than high school boys.

* College women are legal.

* In college, when you miss a class (or two or three), you don't need a note
from your parents saying you were skip....uh, sick that day.

* In high school, you can't go out to lunch because it's not allowed. In
college, you can't go out to lunch because you can't afford it.

                     University Student's Dissertation

Hubert Humphrey was asked to be an advisor on a university student's
dissertation.  A request he accepted with delight.  All proceeded well and
on the date the paper was due the student delivered a nicely bound
copy. Two months went by and the student hadn't heard a word.  So, he went
to Mr.  Humphrey's office and asked him what he thought of the paper.

"Well," said Mr.  Humphrey, "I think it needs to be redone."

Although dejected, the student decided to take another crack at the
project.

And two months later, the student delivered the new version to
Mr. Humphrey, and another month went by without hearing a word.  So, again,
the student went to see Mr. Humphrey, and again was told the paper had to
be redone.

Totally beside himself, the student went back to the drawing board and
rewrote the paper for a third time.  Two months later he returned to
Mr. Humphrey's office with the new term paper in hand and said to him,

"I've re-researched and rewritten to the extent that I've left no stone
unturned and no thought unanalysed.  There is just nothing more I can do."

"OK," said Mr.  Humphrey, "I guess I will read this one."

From: "Christopher Brown" <cbrown@chem1.chem.dal.ca>

Let us suppose that an ichthyologist is exploring the life of the ocean. He
casts a net into the water and brings up a fishy assortment. Surveying his
catch, he proceeds in the usual manner of a scientist to systematise what
it reveals. He arrives at two generalisations:

(1) No sea-creature is less than two inches long
(2) All sea-creatures have gills.

These are both true of his catch, and he assumes tentatively that they will
remain true however often he repeats it.  In applying this analogy, the
catch stands for the body of knowledge which constitutes physical science,
and the net for the sensory and intellectual equipment which we use in
obtaining it. The casting of the net corresponds to observation; for
knowledge which has not been or could not be obtained by observation is not
admitted into physical science.  An onlooker may object that the first
generalization is wrong. "There are plenty of sea-creatures under two
inches long, only your net is not adapted to catch them." The icthyologist
dismisses this objection contemptuously. "Anything uncatchable by my net is
ipso facto outside the scope of icthyological knowledge. In short, "what my
net can't catch isn't fish."  Or-to translate the analogy - "If you are not
simply guessing, you are claiming a knowledge of the physical universe
discovered in some other way than by the methods of physical science, and
admittedly unverifiable by such methods. You are a metaphysician. Bah!"

2.2  No matter what the result, there is always someone eager to
     misinterpret it.
2.3  No matter what happens, there is always someone who believes it
     happened according to his pet theory.

                       THE FINAGLE FACTOR
(Sometimes called the SWAG(Scientific Wild-Assed Guess) Constant)

That quantity which, when multiplied by, divided by, added to, or
subtracted from the answer which you got, yields the answer you
should have gotten.

[note]   Items such as 'Finagle's Constant' and the more subtle 'Bougerre
         Factor' are loosely grouped, in mathematics, under constant
         variables, or, if you prefer, variable constants.

Finagle's Constant, a multiplier of the zero-order term, may be
characterized as changing the universe to fit the equation.

The Bougerre (pronounced 'bugger') Factor is characterized as changing the
equation to fit the universe.  It is also known as the 'Soothing Factor';
mathematically similar to the damping factor, it has the characteristic
of dropping the subject under discussion to zero importance.

A combination of the two, the Diddle Coefficient, is characterized as
changing things so that universe and equation appear to fit without
requiring a change in either.

           AN ANALYTIC STUDY OF THE LEAST PUBLISHABLE INCREMENT

Abstract

This paper presents an analytic study of the least publishable increment
(LPI). The LPI is defined as the smallest acceptable difference between two
publishable papers. Two metrics for the LPI are derived. The first metric
is based on a generalized distance measure derived from the Hausdorff
metric and is used to differentiate between papers on similar topics by
different authors. The second metric describes a distance measure for
papers from the same author.

Further studies using cross-journal and conference proceedings relations
are also discussed. We outline a simple strategy for maximal publication
based on these distance measures. An illustrative example of the maximal
publication scheme is shown and its correlation to actual publications is
also given.

We present a proof that maximal publication based on the LPI is an optimal
approach for junior faculty members attempting to get tenure.

Footnotes that Somehow Got Left out of Published Manuscripts

Edwin A. Locke, Ronan M Conroy and others

These footnotes were found behind the editor's desk. They seem to have
fallen off manuscripts which were being processed, but unfortunately it
is not possible to identify the specific manuscripts.


(Note: These footnotes were originally published by Edwin Locke, of the
Society of Organizational and Industrial Psychologists. I managed to
contact Dr Locke after many years and he doesn't recognise half of them.
I am guilty of a certain amount of input, but so too are an unknown
number of anonymous hands.)


FOOTNOTES
1. The second author designed the study.  The research assistant
(credited in the very small print at the end) carried it out and wrote it
up.  The first author is a Very Important Professor who has generously
donated the weight of his prestige.

2.  Previous reviews by associate editors of 3 other journals, all of
whom rejected the manuscript, totalled 27 single-spaced pages of
comments, all of which we ignored as they were clearly motivated by
professional jealosy.

3.  Many of the references in this paper are totally unrelated to the
topic of the study, but we added them to make the paper look scholarly.
3a. The remaining references were chosen for the quality of their
contribution to the field, hence the preponderance of citations of
previous papers by the present authors.

4. The hypotheses were invented after-the-fact to explain the totally
unpredicted and seemingly nonsensical results we obtained.

5. Two subjects were omitted for noncompliance with the protocol and a
further 67 subjects were discarded for non-compliance with the hypotheses.

6.  The original questionnaire included 100 predictor scales. This study
reports the results for the 5 that were picked out by a stepwise
regression package that the research assistant got from her flatmate.

7. We tried 37 different analytic techniques, some invented in ancient
China,  including  Optician's c-test, Hate's d-test, the Lastwill n-test,
Pretty's q-test, the Van Gough r-test, Washes' y-test, followed by the
Wineman post-hock test. The one reported here (The Kawasaki
Inverted-Listerine Analysis) was the only one that got significant
results.

8. We ran 12 pilot studies and finally got the design to work after
threatening the subjects with bodily harm.

9. A copy of the data is available from the authors.  This is in the form
of a binary dataset on an Atari disk which can be read by any COBOL
compiler earlier than 1972. As we are at present upgrading out copy of
SAS, we will be unable to handle any requests for data for the next five
years, at which time we hope to have carried all the manuals upstairs
into the office (if they haven't collapsed inwards under their own mass
and formed a neutron star). Please write to us then. ("Thank you for your
belated inquiry about our data.  Unfortunately they have been discarded
because they are more than 5 years old"  The Authors).

                    The turbo-encabulator in industry.

For more then 50 years the Arthur D. Little Industrial Bulletin has
endeavored to interpret scientific information in terms that he lay person
could understand. "The turbo-encabulator in industry" is the contribution
of J.H. Quick, graduate member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers
in London, England, and was, first published in the Institution's Students'
Quarterly Journal in December 1944, It is here reprinted without the kind
permission of that publication and of the author in a further salute to
Quick.

For a number of years now, work has been proceeding to bring perfection to
the crudely conceived idea of a machine that would not only supply inverse
reactive current for use in unilateral phase detractors, but would also be
capable of automatically synchronizing cardinal grammeters.

Such a machine is the "turbo-encabulator." Basically, the only new
principle involved is that instead of power being generated by the relative
motion of conductors and fluxes, it is produced by the medial interaction
of magneto-reluctance and capacitive directance.

The original machine had a base plate of prefabulated amulite, surmounted
by a malleable logarithmic casing in such a way that the two spurving
bearings were in direct line with the pentametric fan. The latter consisted
simply of six hydrocoptic marzelvanes, so fitted to the ambifacient lunar
waneshaft that side fumbline was effectively prevented. The main winding
was of the normal lotus-0-delta type placed in panendermic semiboiloid
slots in the stator, every seventh conductor being connected by a
nonreversible tremie pipe to the differential gridlespring on the "up" end
of the grammeters.

Forty-one manestically spaced grouting brushes were arranged to feed into
the rotor slipstream a mixture of high S-value phenylhydrobenzamine and 5%
remanative tetryliodohexamine. Both of these liquids have specific
pericosities given by P=2.5C.n(exponent)6.7 where n is the diathetical
evolute of retrograde temperature phase disposition and C is Chlomondeley's
annular grillage coefficient. Initially, n was measured with the aid of
metaploar refractive pilfrometer (for a description of this ingenious
instrument, see Reference 1), but up to the present, nothing has been found
to equal the transcendental hopper dadoscope (2).

Electrical engineers will appreciate the difficulty of nubing together a
regurgitative purwell and a supramitive wennelsprock. Indeed, this proved
to be a stumbling block to further development until, in 1942, it was found
that the use of anhydrous nangling pins enabled a kryptonastic boiling shim
to the tankered.

The early attempts to construct a sufficiently robust spiral decommutator
failed largely because of a lack of appreciation of the large quasipiestic
stresses in the gremlin studs; the latter were specifically designed to
hold the roffit bars to the spamshaft. When, however, it was discovered
that spending could be prevented by a simple addition to the living
sockets, almost perfect running was secured.

The operating point is maintained as near as possible to the h.f. rem peak
by constantly fromaging the bitumogenous spandrels. This is a distinct
advance on the standard nivel-sheave in that no dramcock oil is required
after the phase detractors have remissed.

Undoubtedly, the turbo-encabulator has not reached a very high level of
technical development, It has been successfully used for operating nofer
trunnions. In addition, whenever a barescent skor motion is required, it
may be employed in conjunction with a drawn reciprocating dingle arm to

From an unknown but astute source:
Every new scientist must learn early that it is never good taste to
designate the sum of two quantities in the form:

                1 + 1 = 2                                               (1)

Anyone who has made a study o f advanced mathematics is aware that:
        1 = ln e
        1 = sin^2 x + cos^2 x

             \inf
        2 = sum     1/2^n
            n=

Therefore eq. (1) can be expressed more scientifically as:


                             \inf
ln e + sin^2 x + cos^2 x =   sum     1/2^n                              (2)
                              n=


This may be further simplified by use of the relations:

        1 = cosh y sqrt(1 - tanh^2 y)

        e = lim     (1+1/z)^z
            z-> inf

Equation (2) may therefore be rewritten as:

                                            inf  cosh y sqrt(1 - tanh^2 y)
ln[ lim (1+1/z)^z ] + sin^2 x + cos^2 x =  SUM ____________________________
    z-> inf                                n=             2^n

                                                                        (3)

At this point it should be obvious that eq. (3) is much clearer and more
easily onderstood than eq. (1). Other methods of a similar nature could be
used to clarify eq. (1), but these are easily divined once the reader
grasps the underlying principles.

                       Anyday, February 31, 1996
Dear Jerry,

  We regret to inform you that we have reanalyzed the current fiscal
situation in the company and have come to the decision that the position
which you currently hold will be phased out in the next few months.  As you
have been a loyal employee for the past twenty years, we will be offering
you an early retirement package wich will hopefully fulfill all of your
requirements.  We wish you the best of luck in your future endeavours and
hope that you will stay in touch.

                                    Sincerely,

                                         Elaine Robinson, CEO

Analysis of Fiscal Responsibilities in the Company Superstructure
  Robinson, Elaine (CEO), et al.

  The following treatise describes the results of the most recent findings
of the study of monetary fluctuarions in the area of resource management,
especially with regard to the placement and distribution of human
resources.  There is an indication from the data wich has been presented
(see Figure 1a) that the future fiscal situation  will indicate
deficiencies.  While this is counter to the previous results (Company
profile, 1994 and 1995), we feel strongly that the data suggests a
realignment of personnel placements, although we do not discount other
avenues of readjustment (for a review, see Memo #17, 1996).  While the
analysis is not complete, the projection of the curve (Figure 2) indicates
that the changes which we propose should occur within a time frame amenable
to stabilizing the situation.
  Previous results (Employee Profile, 1976-1995) have suggested other
possible scenarios but the present situation (Figure 3) causes our group to
re-evaluate.  Owing to the enormity of our proposal, certain allowances
have been established (Table 1) to deal with the current findings and we
will soon present more findings regarding the extended time vector (data
not shown, in preparation).

Note added in proof:  Further analysis has indicated a strong preference
for the sacrifice of specific variables, with particular reference to Jerry.

1. A research team proceeded toward the apex of a natural geologic
protuberance, the purpose of their expedition being the procurement of a
sample of fluid hydride of oxygen in a large vessel, the exact size of which
was unspecified. One member of the team precipitately descended, sustaining
severe fractural damage to the upper cranial portion of his anatomical
structure. Subsequently, the second member of the team performed a
self-rotational translation oriented in the direction taken by the first
member.

7. A male human of undetermined age and designated by an alliterative name
offered osculatory attentions to an undesignated number of young females,
resulting in the lachrymatory responses by said females. Subsequent
emergence of the females from the indoor confinement with the intent of
recreational activity was then accompanied by a highly precipitant
conveyence of the male subject from the vicinity.

8. A young human female, not yet in a state of wedlock, occupied a small
supportive structure, simultaneously undertaking the consumption of
nutriments comprising (a) the coagulated portion of lactic fuild and (2)
the aqueous residue of coagulated lactic fluid. The approach of an arachnid
followed by establishment of said arachnid upon the supportive structure in
close proximity to the subject, caused severe trauma in said subject,
resulting in rapid self- translation of the subject from the environs.

9. A geriatose human female proceeded to a storage compartment for the
purpose of procuring a fragment of osseous tissue from an unidentified
deceased specimen to transfer to an indigent carnivorous domesticated
mammal, 'Canis familiars', family 'Canidae'. Upon arrival at her intended
destination, the human female discovered the storage compartment in a
denuded condition, with the consequence that the indigent carnivore was
deprived of the intended donation.

10. A ritual chant concerning both (a) a small British coin and (b) a small
pouch incorporated as as integral part of an item of clothing, said pouch
being charged with its full capacity with a hardy cereal grain, preceded
the preparation of a baked crusted nutritive composition comprising of
24.00 creatures of the species 'Turdus merula'. Upon terminating of the
closed state of said crusted composition, the avain creatures commenced a
melodic performance, resulting in the composition being considered of a
choice nature befitting presentation to a personage of royal lineage.

11. A human female of anile disposition established occupancy in a form of
structure orginally designated for the encasement of the end part of a
human leg. The plurality of descendents of the subject was of a nature to
cause continual perplexity and misjudgement on the part of said
subject. Amelioration of the prevailing conditions was effected by
furnishing the descendents with a repast comprising of a light gruel
unaccompanied by solid wheaten material, followed by adminstration of
severe flagellation prior to nocturrnal repose.

                           New Latex commands

   We propose the following extensions to the current version of Latex.
We anticipate that it will help many struggling scientists who agonize
over the correct formatting of their scientific papers.

\wave:

The generic \wave command : this is used to simulate waving various
objects in your documents.

 For example, a difficult proof for a theorem can be effectively
finished with a \wave{\hand} command.

 A criticism of someone who caught errors in your previous papers can be
made scathing with the \wave{\finger} command.

 We also recommend that all papers finish with a friendly \wave{\bye}
command,

\namedrop:

 This powerful extension allows the scientist to justify research of
dubious value with a set of names chosen from an extensive database. The
database consists of names such as Don Knuth, Alan Turing, Andrew Wiles
, Einstein.  The database also contains a list of all the papers that
these illustrious scientists have written. \namedrop chooses a random
paper corresponding to the name chosen.

 We realize that \namedrop has a severe limitation. After all, an
unproven and outrageous claim cannot always be attributed to the name of
a living (or recently dead) person. There are people who actually cross
check all references - no, really !  To obviate this difficulty, we
propose the all powerful \namedrop{God} command.

 The citation at the end of the paper becomes

[5] God, personal communication.

 There are options on choosing Gods from a variety of religions.
{\namedrop{God{Vishnu}}} The only drawback in using this option is that
one can only cite Gods from one religion in a paper.  For some
inexplicable reason, Latex does not work if we allow the multiple
religion option.


Verbose commands:

 Following Seinfeld, we also have a \yada-yada command which substitutes
randomly chosen text (from a database) to fill up several pages.  We do
not recommend that this option is used to fill up the whole paper as
that may look suspicious.  If one needs to do that, we strongly
recommend that the \namedrop{God} option and the powerful \wave{\knife}
option be used liberally at the beginning of the paper.  Currently, we
only have Kitty Kelly's masterpiece "Jackie Oh!"  in our database.


\graphs:

 This option allows the user to include graphs that simulate actual
statistical experiments into the paper.  The graph usually have the
following characteristic: there is one best case line and one worst case
line. There are options to refer to others' experiments for the worst
case.  This is a powerful tool to criticize your colleagues work with
scientific proof and not just words.

We are excited about bringing these tools in front of the scientific
community.  Please send us your responses (aroy@cs.uoregon.edu) about
further additions to the list.

                                    GRAMMAR

[This is not really science, but it *was* published in Physical Review
Letters.]

It is said that back in the 1940's, the following message was prominently
displayed at the front of the main chemistry lecture hall at a major
university:

     The English language is your most versatile
     scientific instrument. Learn to use it with
     precision.

In the intervening years, the teaching of proper grammar in the public
elementary and high schools fell into disfavor. The inevitable result is
that manuscripts submitted to us are often full of grammatical errors,
which their authors probably do not even recognize (and often would not
care about if they did).

We regard this state of affairs as deplorable, and we want to do something
about it. For many years we have tried to correct the grammar of papers
that we publish. This is toilsome at best, and sometimes entails rather
substantial rephrasing. It would obviously be preferable to have authors
use correct grammar in the first place. The problem is how to get them to
do it.

One fairly effective way is to provide examples of what not to do; it is
particularly helpful if the examples are humorous. We have recently seen
several lists of grammatical examples of this type. A few weeks ago we
found taped to a colleague's office door the most complete one we have
seen. (He tells us it was passed out in a class of Darthmouth - not in
English - at the time a term paper was assigned). We reproduce it here in
the hope that it will have some effect.

 1 Make sure each pronoun agrees with their antecedent.
 2 Just between you and I, the case of pronoun is important.
 3 Watch out for irregular verbs which have crope into English.
 4 Verbs has to agree in number with their subjects.
 5 Don't use no double negatives.
 6 Being bad grammar, a writer should not use dangling modifiers.
 7 Join clauses good like a conjunction should.
 8 A writer must be not shift your point of view.
 9 About sentence fragments.
10 Don't use run-on sentences you got to punctuate them.
11 In letters essays and reports use commas to separate items in series.
12 Don't use commas, which are not necessary.
13 Parenthetical words however should be enclosed in commas.
14 Its important to use apostrophes right in everybodys writing.
15 Don't abbrev.
16 Check to see if you any words out.
17 In the case of a report, check to see that jargonwise, it's A-OK.
18 As far as incomplete constructions, they are wrong.
19 About repetition, the repetition of a word might be real effective
   repetition - take, for instance the repetition of Abraham Lincoln.
20 In my opinion, I think that an author when he is writing should
    definitely not get into the habit of making use of too many unnecessary
    words that he does not really need in order to put his message across.
21 Use parallel construction not only to be concise but also clarify.
22 It behooves us all to avoid archaic expressions.
23 Mixed metaphors are a pain in the neck and ought to be weeded out.
24 Consult the dictionery to avoid mispelings.
25 To ignorantly split an infinitive is a practice to religiously avoid.
26 Last but not least, lay of cliches.

Articles are warped by "unexplained acronyms, cryptic symbols, endless

exists, Phillip Schewe (American Institute of Physics, US) says:

"You lose all your readers, but at least you can't be accused of being an
idiot.  Instead, the readers are made to feel like they're idiots."

                             By: Wm Shakespipette

All the world's a lab,
And all the men and women merely subjects:
They have theri theses and exams,
And one doc in his time plans many experiments
His notes in seven stages.  At first the _undergrad_,
mewlink and puking at the frat house jams.
And then the winning _doctorate_, with his papers
And statistical analysis, doing just enough
If only to graduate.  And then the _postdoc_,
Wailing like hell, with a woeful ballad
Of experiments gone sour.  Then _assoicate prof_,
Full of strange theories and requiring a tech,
Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in temper,
Seeking the bubble reputation
While kissing the chairman's butt.  And then the _tenure_,
In fair round belly with good postdocs lined,
With eyes severe and pen to thesis cut,
Full of wise saws and forgotten techniques;
And so he plays his part.  The sixt stage shifts
To the lean and slippered _chair_
With spectacles on nose and job on the side,
His theories of youth, well saved, a world to weird
For his shrunk grant; and so his "go get'em" attitude
Turning again towards mild caution, tempered
Theories all around.  Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is status _emeritus_ and mere oblivion,
sans students, sans postdocs, sans grants, sans everything.

'Twas spring break, and the student droves
  Did drink and snorkle in Florida:
Most times mainly without clothes,
  And their Lit and Math ignorida.

"Beware the Professor, my son!
  The jaws that lecture, the hands that grade!
Beware the Teaching Assistant: shun!
  And the frumpy Librarian evade!"

He took his laptop computer in hand:
  Long time the passing grade he sought--
But rested he in lecture-hall dreamland,
  and dreamed awhile of nought.

And, while in daydreamy thought he drooled,
 The Professor, with sinusitis a flame,
Came sniffling into the lecture hall,
 And teaching as he came!

One, two! One, two! And through and through
 The Prof wrote theorem, lemma, proof!
But alas, the laptop battery went dead
 and all the notes went "poof."

"And hast thou pleased the Professor?
 Come to my arms, my Baccalaureate boy!
O Graduation day!" But "Student loans to

... There can be no doubt about faith and not reason being the ultima ratio.
Even Euclid, who has laid himself as little open to the charge of credulity
as any writer who ever lived, cannot get beyond this. He has no demonstrable
first premise. He requires postulates and axioms which transcend
demonstration, and without which he can do nothing. His superstructure
indeed is demonstration, but his ground his faith. Nor again can he get
further than telling a man he is a fool if he persists in differing from
him. He says "which is absurd," and declines to discuss the matter further.
Faith and authority, therefore, prove to be as necessary for him as for
anyone else.

                     CLARKE'S LAWS
Arthur C. Clarke (1917-)

When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is
possible, he is almost certainly right.  When he states that something
is impossible, he is very probably wrong.
                   _Profiles of the Future_ (1962; rev. 1973)
                  ``Hazards of Prophecy: The Failure of Imagination''
                                              Clarke's First Law
On which he commented:

Perhaps the adjective ``elderly'' requires definition.  In physics,
mathematics, and astronautics it means over thirty; in the other
disciplines, senile decay is sometimes postponed to the forties.
There are, of course, glorious exceptions; but as every researcher
just out of college knows, scientists of over fifty are good for
nothing but board meetings, and should at all costs be kept out of the
laboratory!
                 _Profiles of the Future_ (1962; rev. 1973)
                 ``Hazards of Prophecy: The Failure of Imagination''

But the only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to
venture a little way past them into the impossible.
           _Profiles of the Future_ (1962; rev. 1973)
          ``Hazards of Prophecy: The Failure of Imagination''
                                              Clarke's Second Law

Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
                 _Profiles of the Future_ (1962; rev. 1973)
                ``Hazards of Prophecy: The Failure of Imagination''
                                              Clarke's Third Law

Clarke adds: As three laws were good enough for Newton, I have
modestly decided to stop there.

A post with the ``first law'' invariably gets followed up with one
mentioning this:

When, however, the lay public rallies round an idea that is denounced
by distinguished but elderly scientists and supports that idea with
great fervor and emotion--the distinguished but elderly scientists are
then, after all, probably right.

The value the world sets upon motives is often grossly unjust and

yet it is the former that moves one of the most useful men the human race
has yet produced: the scientific investigator.  What actually urges him on
is not some brummagem idea of Service, but a boundless, almost pathological
thirst to penetrate the unknown, to uncover the secret....  His prototype

Lectures were once useful; but now, when all can read, and books are so

book. . . . People have nowadays got a strange opinion that everything
should be taught by lectures. Now, I cannot see that lectures can do as

   INDICATIONS THAT YOUR NEW CLASS MIGHT BE MORE THAN YOU BARGAINED FOR

We've all had classes like it: you go into it expecting it to be of
middling difficulty, only to find out very quickly that this is going to be
one of those terms that teaches you *exactly* how long you can go without
doing laundry. One of those terms where you adopt a hunter-gatherer
semi-nomadic lifestyle, and subsist soley from food scavenged from academic
seminars. One of those terms where you spend more time in lab than you do
in your room. I'm currently wrapping up just such a term. Looking back,
there were numerous signs in the first week that indicated the path this
class was to take.

Things that are Bad Signs and indicate that your class is going to be a
bitch:

-The syllabus has written on it "Class Motto: That which does not kill us
only makes us stronger" (this was the first warning sign);
-What is normally a full class under other professors has only seven people
in it under this one, and one of them ends up dropping the class after
falling ill, missing two days of lecture and lab, and discovering that
she's too far behind to ever catch up;
-When you tell friends who's teaching your class, they get the same look on
their face that they might get if you told them that your dog just died;
-While discussing what his tests are like, the professor mentions casually
that he considers it perfectly acceptable to test you on things that aren't
covered by the textbook, in lecture, or in lab ("I give you guys tools to
solve certain types of problems, and you should be able to extrapolate from
there. Assimilate, Correlate, and Synthesize- that's the second class
motto.");
-The class average on the first test is a 60%, and the prof is impressed;
-You find yourself taking more pages of notes in the first week than you
usually do in a month of most other classes;

UNOFFICIAL MANUAL FOR GRADUATE TEACHING ASSISTANTS
LATE HOMEWORK

1.When a student turns in his/her project two weeks late and asks for full
credit, accept the late work and tell them that it will be awarded full
credit. However, do inform them that you will not have time to grade it
until after you complete your Ph.D.

DISRUPTIVE STUDENTS

1.If students will not stop talking when the class period begins, announce
that there will be a quiz the following day on today's lecture. Then leave.

2.If your students are prone to reading the school paper in class, try
taking out a full page ad in the paper informing them that they are going
to flunk your class.

LECTURES

1.In the event that you are unprepared for a lecture, be sure to use the
class time to stress to the class the importance of keeping up with the
readings. In fact, spend most of the class time stressing this.

2.When the time comes to lecture on a subject you know nothing about, the
art of controlled digression is invaluable. Here, you try to incite
unrelated questions from the class which you answer at length. Then at the
end of class you scold them for digressing and tell them they'll just have
to get the material from the book.

GRADING

1.Always use a fire engine red felt-tip marker with a 1/2 inch tip to grade
papers. Position your comments strategically so that they spell "DUMB" when
seen from a distance.

2.You may grade assignments however you like. Here is a guide to quick and
easy grading:
20 % Name
20 % Penmanship
50 % Homework is stapled together
10 % The work itself
Warning: Be prepared for a 60% class average.
 GRADING ERRORS

1.If student A approaches you complaining that an answer on their exam was
marked incorrect but was marked correct on student B's exam, promptly mark
student B's answer incorrect as well. This will redirect the heat from you
onto student A.

EXTRA CREDIT

1.If students request extra credit to make up for the homework they didn't
turn in, be sure to make the opportunity available to them. Some good extra
credit problems are:

Solve the dining philosophers problem, using semaphores.
Write a C compiler for the Commodore 64.
Translate Moby Dick into ASCII-8 code with a leftmost odd parity bit.
Design a replacement for the 80486 chip.
Build a File Allocation Table (FAT) out of balsa wood.

2.You may also wish to tell the student that they can do extra credit work
while you decide whether to accept it. When the student turns in the work,
decide against it.

CHEATING

1.When it is obvious to you that several people have copied each others
homework, grade one person's work on a separate sheet of paper, then
photocopy your comments onto everyone else's homework.

2.Should you have very skilled cheaters in your class, try giving incorrect
information during your lectures. This should result in incorrect answers
on exams. Examples that have proven effective at this technique include:
The three components of a computer system are Larry, Moe, and Curly.
The only possible digits in the binary system are 0, 1, and 2.
The three components of the CPU are the ALU, REGISTERS, and cheap bathroom
lighting fixtures.
The microphone is an output device.
"Booting" the computer involves waving a large magnet over your hard drive
for 60 seconds.
MS-DOS is the operating system for the CRAY Y-MP.
When preparing to purchase a new computer system running Windows, you
should make sure it has at least 128,000 bytes of main memory.
Protocols include saluting your computer and calling the mouse "sir".
CPU stands for Ceramic Public Urinal.
Structured Programming says that you can write any computer program using
only three basic control structures: Sequence, Selection, and Guessing.
LAB

You are expected to spend at least 4 hours each week in the lab to assist
with student's questions. Student's have been known to come up with some
real beauties:
"Why should I save it? I wasn't done yet."
"My disk erased itself!"
"Hurry up, I need help. This was due last week."
"Directory? What's that?"
"What do I need my textbook for? I'm using a computer."
Here are the solutions to the most common problems:
P: "The screen is blank - I can't see what I'm doing"
S: Turn on the monitor

P: "How do I get into Windows?"
S: Stare at it long enough and it will start to look like candy.

P: "I can't get this computer to do anything."
S: Have them move to a computer that has a keyboard.

P: "The stupid printer printed the wrong file."
S: Reprimand the printer.

P: "WordPerfect didn't do what I told it to do."
S: Tell them they have to earn its respect first.

During a rather dull anatomic lecture, the old professor had abruptly
inserted the beginning of the sentence: "So that not to become
pregnant...", by which all students were wakened up. Not finishing it, he
continued his discourse. He repeated this trick several times, at neither
of them finishing the intriguing sentence but still keeping his auditory
awake.
After the lecture he was approached by one student:
- But, professor, what was that means for not to become pregnant?
- Oh, that... it's a cup of coffee.
- But before or after ...?
- Instead.

(If any of these are not original, please blame it on my Commerce 335
professor, Dr. Yair Wand.  Otherwise, all humour can be attributed to him as
the source.)

A physics professor was very strict about attendance, and despised
tardiness.  Every student caught arriving to class late (especially those
interrupting his lecture) was quickly reprimanded in front of the whole
class.  Students were quick to comment on the professor's genetics.  Well,
one day a student entered through the front doors of the lecture hall,
while the prof was writing notes on the chalkboard.  The professor caught
the student out of the corner of his eye (this acute sense of peripheral
vision, further supported the rumours of his evolution), and turned to face
the student.  He demanded, "What do you think you're doing?".  Being a
science student, one naturally thinks quickly, so the student snapped up
and replied, "I came down from the back to get a better look at the board".
The prof smiled.

Back in those days, it was required that in order for a student to receive
credit for a particular course, a card (listing of his/her courses) had to
be signed by the instructor/lecturer.  It was, at the time, policy that
students attend their courses.  But depending on the size of the class, it
was often quite possible to receive credit, even after not attending the
class regularly.  Not so, with this physics professor...if he didn't
recognize you, you would have to repeat the course (& attend!).  On one
occasion, a student handed his card to be signed.  The professor looked at
the name, then at the student, and said, "I've never seen you in my class,"
and handed back the card.  Now being a science student, he naturally
thought quickly, and proceeded to the end of the line.  When he was at the
front again, he handed his card to the prof. The prof looked at the name,
then at the student, and said, "You look familiar.  OK", and signed the
card.
___________________________________________________________________________
   A professor was known for being an easy grader.  The grades he gave for a
survey course (i. e. the type where you are expected to learn generalities and
not specifics) were based entirely on two exams, and the stuff on the exams was
entirely covered in the textbook.  So showing up for class wasn't a big deal.
   However, this started to get out of hand.  As word of the course spread, at
each semester, there was a larger block of students who would show up
infrequently or not at all, except for the exam days.  Finally, it got so bad
that about half of the students one term never showed before the midterm.  On
the day of the midterm, everyone came in and a graduate assistant handed out
exams, "Prof x. is sick, so he asked me to give you your exams."
   There was only one question in the exam booklets: "Which one of the pictures
below is of professor x?"
   Obviously, the students who never showed up didn't know and had to guess.
Many failed, while the students who had been showing up regularly got A's.

                            SHORTAGE OF PROSTITUTES

Annoyed by the professor of anatomy who liked to tell "naughty" stories
during class, a group of female students decided that the next time he
started to tell one, they would all rise and leave the room in protest.

The professor, however, got wind of their scheme just before class the
following day, so he bided his time.  Then, halfway through the lecture,
he began.

"They say there is quite a shortage of prostitutes in France."

The girls looked at one another, arose and started for the door.

"Young ladies," said the professor with a broad smile, "the next plane
doesn't leave till tomorrow afternoon."

This happened in a class I was attending a few years ago.

While giving a lecture on the mechanics of momentum and kinetic energy
transfer, my physics professor noticed a student busily snoozing in the
fourth row of the auditorium. He turned to a girl sitting in the first
row and asked her what the result of a collision between two particles
with masses, velocities, and trajectories that he specified would be.
After a few seconds of thinking and calculating she came up with the
correct answer.

The professor then awoke the sleeping student and said, "You! Same
question!"

The student, a bit stunned and bleary eyed, looked around and replied,
"Same answer."

After the laughter died down the professor turned around and said, "OK,
you got me on that one, I won't call on you again..."

A professor stood before his class of 20 senior organic biology
students, about to hand out the final exam. "I want to say that it's
been a pleasure teaching you this semester. I know you've all worked
extremely hard and many of you are off to medical school after
summer break. So that no one gets their GP messed up because they
might have been celebrating a bit too much this week, anyone who
would like to opt out of the final exam today will receive a "B" for
the course."

There was much rejoicing amongst the class as students got up,
passed by the professor to thank him and sign out on his offer.

As the last taker left the room, the professor looked out over the
handful of remaining students and asked, "Any one else? This is your
last chance." One final student rose up and took the offer.

The professor closed the door and took attendance of those students
remaining. "I'm glad to see you believe in yourself," he said. "You
all have "A's."

faith."

"Text makes a satisfying 'thud' when dropped on the floor."

"The class was worthwhile because I need it for the degree."

"His blackboard technique puts Rembrandt to shame."

"Textbook is confusing... Someone with a knowledge of English should
proofread it."

"Have you ever fell asleep in class and awoke in another?  That's the way I
felt all term."

"In class I learn I can fudge answers and get away with it."

"Keep lecturer or tenure board will be shot."

"The recitation instruction would make a good parking lot attendant Tries
to tell you where to go, but you can never understand him."

"Text is useless.  I use it to kill roaches in my room."

"In class the syllabus is more important than you are."

"I am convinced that you can learn by osmosis by just sitting in his
class."

"Help! I've fallen asleep and I can't wake up!"

"Problem sets are a decoy to lure you away from potential exam material."

the text."

"What's the best quality of the text? 'Text is printed on high quality
paper.'"

Subject: Science vs God
An anonymous dialogue, which I found brilliant and insightful:
"Professing to be wise, they became fools . . . "

"Let me explain the problem science has with Jesus Christ."  The atheist
professor of philosophy pauses before his class and then asks one of his
new students to stand. "You're a Christian, aren't you, son?"

"Yes, sir."

"So you believe in God?"

"Absolutely."

"Is God good?"

"Sure!  God's good."

"Is God all-powerful?  Can God do anything?"

"Yes."

"Are you good or evil?"

"The Bible says I'm evil."

The professor grins knowingly. "Ahh! THE BIBLE!"  He considers for a
moment. "Here's one for you.  Let's say there's a sick person over here and
you can cure him.  You can do it.  Would you help them?  Would you try?"

"Yes sir, I would."

"So you're good...!"

"I wouldn't say that."

"Why not say that?  You would help a sick and maimed person if you
could... in fact most of us would if we could...God doesn't.

(No answer.)

He doesn't, does he?  My brother was a Christian who died of cancer even
though he prayed to Jesus to heal him. How is this Jesus good?  Hmmm?  Can
you answer that one?"

(No answer)

The elderly man is sympathetic. "No, you can't, can you?"  He takes a sip
of water from a glass on his desk to give the student time

to relax.  In philosophy, you have to go easy with the new ones.  "Let's
start again, young fella.  Is God good?"

"Er... Yes."

"Is Satan good?"

"No."

"Where does Satan come from?"

The student falters.  "From... God..."

"That's right. God made Satan, didn't he?" The elderly man runs his bony
fingers through his thinning hair and turns to the smirking, student
audience. "I think we're going to have a lot of fun this semester, ladies
and gentlemen."  He turns back to the Christian.  "Tell me, son, Is there
evil in this world?"

"Yes, sir."

"Evil's everywhere, isn't it?  Did God make everything?"

"Yes."

"Who created evil?

(No answer)

"Is there sickness in this world? Immorality?  Hatred?  Ugliness?  All the
terrible things - do they exist in this world?"

The student squirms on his feet. "Yes."

"Who created them? "

(No answer)

The professor suddenly shouts at his student. "WHO CREATED THEM?  TELL ME,
PLEASE!"  The professor closes in for the kill and climbs into the
Christian's face. In a still small voice: "God created all evil, didn't He,
son?"

(No answer) The student tries to hold the steady, experienced gaze and
fails.

Suddenly the lecturer breaks away to pace the front of the classroom like
an aging panther. The class is mesmerized.  "Tell me," he continues, "How
is it that this God is good if He created all evil throughout all time?"
The professor swishes his arms around to encompass the wickedness of the
world.  "All the hatred, the brutality, all the pain, all the torture, all
the death and ugliness and all the suffering created by this good God is
all over the world, isn't it, young man?"

(No answer)

"Don't you see it all over the place?  Huh?" Pause.  "Don't you?" The
professor leans into the student's face again and whispers, "Is God good?"

(No answer)

"Do you believe in Jesus Christ, son?"

The student's voice betrays him and cracks. "Yes, professor.  I do."

The old man shakes his head sadly. "Science says you have five senses you
use to identify and observe the world around you.  Have you seen Jesus?"

"No, sir.  I've never seen Him."

"Then tell us if you've ever heard your Jesus?"

"No, sir.  I have not."

"Have you ever felt your Jesus, tasted your Jesus or smelt your Jesus...in
fact, do you have any sensory perception of your God whatsoever?"

(No answer)

"Answer me, please."

"No, sir, I'm afraid I haven't."

"You're AFRAID... you haven't?"

"No, sir."

"Yet you still believe in him?" >>

"...yes..."

"That takes FAITH!"  The professor smiles sagely at the underling.
"According to the rules of empirical, testable, demonstrable protocol,
science says your God doesn't exist.  What do you say to that, son?  Where
is your God now?"

{The student doesn't answer}

"Sit down, please."  The Christian sits...Defeated.

Another Christian raises his hand. "Professor, may I address the class?"

The professor turns and smiles. "Ah, another Christian in the vanguard!
Come, come, young man. Speak some proper wisdom to the gathering."

The Christian looks around the room.  "Some interesting points you are
making, sir.  Now I've got a question for you. Is there such thing as
heat?"

"Yes," the professor replies.  "There's heat."

"Is there such a thing as cold?"

"Yes, son, there's cold too."

"No, sir, there isn't."

The professor's grin freezes. The room suddenly goes very cold.

The second Christian continues. "You can have lots of heat, even more heat,
super-heat, mega-heat, white heat, a little heat or no heat but we don't
have anything called 'cold'.  We can hit 458 degrees below zero, which is
no heat, but we can't go any further after that. There is no such thing as
cold, otherwise we would be able to go colder than 458 - You see, sir, cold
is only a word we use to describe the absence of heat. We cannot measure
cold.  Heat we can measure in thermal units because heat is energy.  Cold
is not the opposite of heat, sir, just the absence of it."

Silence. A pin drops somewhere in the classroom.

"Is there such a thing as darkness, professor?"

"That's a dumb question, son. What is night if it isn't darkness?

What are you getting at...?"

"So you say there is such a thing as darkness?"

"Yes..."

"You're wrong again, sir. Darkness is not something, it is the absence of
something.  You can have low light, normal light, bright light, flashing
light but if you have no light constantly you have nothing and it's called
darkness, isn't it?  That's the meaning we use to define the word.  In
reality, Darkness isn't. If it were, you would be able to make darkness
darker and give me a jar of it. Can you...give me a jar of darker darkness,
professor?"

Despite himself, the professor smiles at the young effrontery before
him. This will indeed be a good semester. "Would you mind telling us what
your point is, young man?"

"Yes, professor. My point is, your philosophical premise is flawed to start
with and so your conclusion must be in error...."

The professor goes toxic.  "Flawed...?  How dare you...!""

"Sir, may I explain what I mean?"

The class is all ears.  "Explain... oh, explain..." The professor makes an
admirable effort to regain control.  Suddenly he is affability itself.  He
waves his hand to silence the class, for the student to continue.

"You are working on the premise of duality," the Christian explains.  "That
for example there is life and then there's death; a good God and a bad
God. You are viewing the concept of God as something finite, something we
can measure. Sir, science cannot even explain a thought.

It uses electricity and magnetism but has never seen, much less fully
understood them. To view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant of
the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive thing.  Death is not the
opposite of life, merely the absence of it."  The young man holds up a
newspaper he takes from the desk of a neighbor who has been reading
it. "Here is one of the most disgusting tabloids this country hosts,
professor. Is there such a thing as immorality?"

"Of course there is, now look..."

"Wrong again, sir.  You see, immorality is merely the absence of
morality. Is there such thing as injustice?  No. Injustice is the absence
of justice. Is there such a thing as evil?" The Christian pauses.  "Isn't
evil the absence of good?"

The professor's face has turned an alarming color. He is so angry he is
temporarily speechless.

The Christian continues. "If there is evil in the world, professor, and we
all agree there is, then God, if he exists, must be accomplishing a work
through the agency of evil. What is that work, God is accomplishing?

The Bible tells us it is to see if each one of us will, of our own free
will, choose good over evil."

The professor bridles. "As a philosophical scientist, I don't view this
matter as having anything to do with any choice; as a realist, I absolutely
do not recognize the concept of God or any other theological factor as
being part of the world equation because God is not observable."

"I would have thought that the absence of God's moral code in this world is
probably one of the most observable phenomena going," the Christian
replies. "Newspapers make billions of dollars reporting it every week!
Tell me, professor, do you teach your students that they evolved from a
monkey?"

"If you are referring to the natural evolutionary process, young man, yes,
of course I do."

"Have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes, sir?"

The professor makes a sucking sound with his teeth and gives his student a
silent, stony stare.

"Professor, since no one has ever observed the process of evolution at work
and cannot even prove that this process is an on-going endeavor, are you
not teaching your opinion, sir? Are you now not a scientist, but a priest?"

"I'll overlook your impudence in the light of our philosophical
discussion. Now, have you quite finished?" the professor hisses.

"So you don't accept God's moral code to do what is righteous?"

"I believe in what is - that's science!"

"Ahh! SCIENCE!" the student's face splits into a grin. "Sir, you rightly
state that science is the study of observed phenomena.  Science too is a
premise which is flawed..."

"SCIENCE IS FLAWED..?" the professor splutters.

The class is in uproar.

The Christian remains standing until the commotion has subsided.  "To
continue the point you were making earlier to the other student, may I give
you an example of what I mean?"

The professor wisely keeps silent.

The Christian looks around the room.  "Is there anyone in the class who has
ever seen the professor's brain?"

The class breaks out in laughter.

The Christian points towards his elderly, crumbling tutor. "Is there anyone
here who has ever heard the professor's brain... felt the professor's
brain, touched or smelt the professor's brain?"  No one appears to have
done so. The Christian shakes his head sadly.  "It appears no-one here has
had any sensory perception of the professor's brain whatsoever.  Well,
according to the rules of empirical, testable, demonstrable protocol,
science says the professor has no brain."

The class is in chaos.  The Christian sits... Because that is what a chair
is for.

            ACADEMIC LIKE ME

Jan 3rd, 1995
I have long heard of the lives of the privileged classes, and now I
have prepared myself to experience life as a member.
Tomorrow, I will don the the uniform of the academic and re-enter
society, NOT as I once was, a worker and pawn of the
educated classes, but as a peer of those very people. Tomorrow, I
shall become an academic!

Jan 4th, 1995
Dressed in a pair of green slacks with shortened legs, red cardigan
and egg-yolk-stained tee-shirt; sporting a scraggly beard
and armed only with a pipe, I stepped onto the University Campus.

Immediately upon mumbling some incomprehensible gibberish, I was
greeted on with respect and awe by my fellow academia

Applying for tenure was simple. The questions were very direct:

   They:   Do you know what you're doing?
   Me:     This is Belgium, right?
   They:   You have a masters in English?
   Me:     I have a Red Volvo!
   They:   And you're applying for a position in the
           department of Physics?
   Me:     I think sometimes, therefore I am illogical!

I was appointed immediately and released to an unsuspecting student
population.

Jan 5th 1995
Today was my first as a lecturer. I prepared concientiously by
drinking heavily, watching lots of television and going to bed very
late the preceding night

Turning up at my lecture the prescribed 1 minute late, I spoke of
Yeats and the passion of his poetry.

The first year Physics students were left speechless.

Jan 6th 1995
I did not go to work today, due to my thinking it was Saturday.

Jan 7th 1995
I did not go to work today, due to my thinking it was a Wednesday

Jan 8th 1995
I went to work today and was distressed at the lack of attendance.

Jan 9th 1995
Being conscientious in the maintenance of my diary, I take a well
deserved holiday knowing that in three more days I will be
eligible for a six month sebattical.

Jan 12th 1995
My lecture this morning was a landmark effort. I launched into the
explanation of the right-hand-rule, then, remembering that I was an
academic, subverted myself into discussing of the right-hand-rule of
hitch-hiking, the dangers of hitchhiking, the dangers of hitching in
South America, my Holiday in South America, the woman I met in South
America, the place she worked at, their physics department, then to
finish off, what their physics department said about the right-hand-
rule.

I think I was well received

Jan 13th 1995
A minor piece of confusion here in that I brought my Telephone book
instead of my lecture notes.

I improvised the basic electrical safety section of the course with
the aid of two paper clips, a student and a handy power point.

I feel sure the class now appreciates the dangers of electricity.

Attendance dropped by one.

Jan 14th
Being a friday, I decide to excite my first year pupils with an
experiment in wave theory. I walked into the lab, waved, and left.

I'm sure my students appreciated the humourous content

Jan 17th
Having now mastered when weekends occur, I turned up to receive
confirmation of my sebattical, taking it, on full pay, immediately

Jul 17th
Back from sebattical I realise that I did not make arrangements for a
stand-in lecturer.

In an attempt to catch up for the lost time, I set the students some
homework, pages 1-375, read and do all exercises.

Jul 18th
Attendance was exceptionally low today with only one student in class.
When I asked him how his homework was going as his
entire coursework depended on it. He screamed and left.

I marked him absent and informed the grants department that no-one was
attending my courses.

Jul 21st
My students are all back having received the letter informing them
that grants are only paid to attending students.

Scholarship students, with a far harsher attendance policy, are openly
weeping.

Jul 24th
I am now eligible for three months extra-curricular sebattical, which
I decide to take immediately, warning my students that the
exam will be held the day I return, covering all aspects of the
course, including the last minute addition of the Encyclopedia
Brittanica to the Book List. I expect all students to have a copy.

Oct 24th.
Exam day. Having no preparation time, I use last years exam and
substitute different values for the equation.

I randomly appoint a student from another class to work out the
answers and mark the exams.

Oct 27th
I receive the results of the exam which indicate that 89% of the class
passed the exam. Lauded as an academic genius, I am
awarded 6 months further paid sebbatical to study the effects of
alcohol on the mind. Starting the third day of term next year.

I think I'm on a winner here.

From: "My Links" <matthew_nied.msn@attcanada.net>
A kind of wierd college professor asked his class a question.
"If Philadelphia is 100 miles from New York and Chicago
is 1060 miles from Philadelphia and Los Angles is 2177 miles
from Chicago,.... how old am I?"

One student in the back of the class raised his hand and when
called upon said, "Professor you're 44.."

The Professor said "You're absolutely correct, but tell me, how
did you arrive at the answer so quickly?"

The student said. "You see professor, I have a brother; he's
22, and he's only half nuts . . ."

=8.7 GRADUATE STUDENTS

___________________________________________________________________________
The upgrade path to the most powerful and satisfying computer:

    * Pocket calculator

    * Commodore Pet / Apple II / TRS 80 / Commodore 64 / Timex Sinclair
      (Choose any of the above)

    * IBM PC

    * Apple Macintosh

    * Fastest workstation of the time (HP, DEC, IBM, SGI: your choice)

    * Minicomputer (HP, DEC, IBM, SGI: your choice)

    * Mainframe (IBM, Cray, DEC: your choice)


And then you reach the pinnacle of modern computing facilities:

*********************************************************
*******     G R A D U A T E   S T U D E N T S    ********
*********************************************************

Yes, you just sit back and do all of your computing through lowly
graduate students.  Imagine the advantages:

    * Multi-processing, with as many processes as you have
      students.  You can easily add more power by promising more
      desperate undergrads that they can indeed escape college
      through your guidance.  Special student units can even
      handle several tasks *on*their*own*!

    * Full voice recognition interface.  Never touch a keyboard or
      mouse again.  Just mumble commands and they *will* be
      understood (or else!).

    * No hardware upgrades and no installation required.  Every
      student comes complete with all hardware necessary.  Never
      again fry a chip or $10,000 board by improper installation!
      Just sit that sniveling student at a desk, give it writing
      utensils (making sure to point out which is the dangerous
      end) and off it goes.

    * Low maintenance.  Remember when that hard disk crashed in
      your Beta 9900, causing all of your work to go the great bit
      bucket in the sky?  This won't happen with grad. students.
      All that is required is that you give them a good *whack!*
      upside the head when they are acting up, and they will run
      good as new.

    * Abuse module.  Imagine yelling expletives at your computer.
      Doesn't work too well, because your machine just sits there
      and ignores you.  Through the grad student abuse module you
      can put the fear of god in them, and get results to boot!

    * Built-in lifetime.  Remember that awful feeling two years
      after you bought your GigaPlutz mainframe when the new
      faculty member on the block sneered at you because his
      FeelyWup workstation could compute rings around your
      dinosaur?  This doesn't happen with grad. students.  When
      they start wearing and losing productivity, simply give them
      the PhD and boot them out onto the street to fend for
      themselves.  Out of sight, out of mind!

    * Cheap fuel: students run on Coca Cola (or the high-octane
      equivalent -- Jolt Cola) and typically consume hot spicy
      chinese dishes, cheap taco substitutes, or completely
      synthetic macaroni replacements.  It is entirely unnecessary
      to plug the student into the wall socket (although this does
      get them going a little faster from time to time).

    * Expansion options.  If your grad. students don't seem to be
      performing too well, consider adding a handy system manager
      or software engineer upgrade.  These guys are guaranteed to
      require even less than a student, and typically establish
      permanent residence in the computer room.  You'll never know
      they are around!  (Which you certainly can't say for an
      AXZ3000-69 150gigahertz space-heater sitting on your desk
      with its ten noisy fans....)  [Note however that the
      engineering department still hasn't worked out some of the
      idiosyncratic bugs in these expansion options, such as
      incessant muttering at nobody in particular, occasionaly

      messages on world-wide bulletin boards.]

So forget your Babbage Engines and abacuses (abaci?) and PortaBooks

In a forest a fox bumps into a little rabbit, and says, "Hi, junior, what
are you up to?"

"I'm writing a dissertation on how rabbits eat foxes," said the rabbit.

"Come now, friend rabbit, you know that's impossible!"

"Well, follow me and I'll show you."

They both go into the rabbit's dwelling and after a while the rabbit emerges
with a satisfied expression on his face.


Along comes a wolf.  "Hello, what are we doing these days?"

"I'm writing the second chapter of my thesis, on how rabbits devour wolves."

"Are you crazy?  Where is your academic honesty?"

"Come with me and I'll show you." ......

As before, the rabbit comes out with a satisfied look on his face
and this time he has a diploma in his paw.

The camera pans back and into the rabbit's cave and, as everybody should
have guessed by now, we see an enourmous  mean-looking lion sitting next
to the bloody and furry remains of the wolf and the fox.

The moral of this story is:

It's not the contents of your thesis that are important --
it's your PhD advisor that counts.

After a party for getting a master degree, one of graduate students says
to colleagues:
"Henceforth I will go only in funerals and not to graduation parties."
"Why that?" ask the others.
"At funerals nobody asks "Are you the next one?"

   "I'd love to write it all over again"
  "Why didn't I just get a job, I could have been making $40,000 a year
   by now if I had just started working with a Bachelor's degree. But
   noooooo, Mom and Dad wanted a masters degree" and
   "I wish somebody would drop a bomb on the school so that I'd
   have an excuse to stop working on this degree that's sucking every
   last drop of life force out of my withered and degraded excuse for
   a soul..." (9 V lithium batteries sold separately)

Umpteen years ago when I was an undergrad the Zoology Department used
to keep a  gibbon under the rooftop sheds.  Every morning and
evening this gibbon would whoop it up and cry like a child, a very
mournful, disturbing and distracting cry that carried half across
the campus. That expression of territorial behavior had many students
mystified.

Well during one of the lab classes a student asked the teaching
assistant "What is that noise?"

Without missing a beat the TA said "Well a few years ago we had a
brillinat student.  Studied too hard.  Couldn't hack it and went mad.
 We had to lock him in the roof to let him finish his thesis."

Our man could certainly tell a whopper when he hears one but
couldn't call the TA a liar. So went to higher authority.

"Prof Harrison, TA says that there is a mad student locked upstairs.
Is that true?"

"Huh?" The Prof's jaw dropped.  One could clearly see the thoughts
that raced through his mind. "What has today brought?"

Then the light bulb lit - Ah! thatTA.


Postscriptum:
I was the only one who saw the whole thing because the joke
went so smoothly and was totally unplanned.  The old prof had passed
away and the TA is now the Asst. Prof.   She said she had no
recollection of the incident but we really had a good laugh  when I
retold that story over a class reunion. Nearly everyone fell off
their chairs.

That student went on to law school.  Always wondered if the gibbon
had anything to do with it.

After 12 long, difficult years of study, my daughter finally earned her
Ph.D.  On the night of her graduation, we celebrated at an exclusive

so happy for you."

"Thanks, Dad," my daughter replied.  "But from now on, it will be DOCTOR

                        GRADUATE EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS

"Many of the requirements of graduate education ...are "dragons."  Dragons
have no purpose except to be slain; that is, they are tests of motivation
to prove how difficult it is to get knighthood (or the valuable doctorate)
and, therefore, how valuable those people must be who already have it (the
faculty)."  --Mills (1953) cited by Karon, 1995 in "Becoming a first-rate
professional psychologist despite graduate education."

6:30 am Wake up and lie awake in bed.

6:31    Realize you spent $18 on last night's dinner, means no eating out
        for the next 6 weeks.

6:32    Hit snooze button.  Go back to sleep.

7:00    Wake up suddenly with heart in mouth when you realize you didn't
        hit the snooze button -- you turned it off.

7:01    Fall asleep again.

7:44    Wake up with heart in mouth again.

7:45    Get ready to go to school, will shave tomorrow, will eat early
        brunch at (Denny's/Penny's/Lenny's/Dinko's whatever cafeteria).

8:03    Arrive at school.  Realize your foreign office mate arrived
        earlier today must have got more work done.

8:04    Pass by Advisor's office, chat with Secretary to find out if he
        is coming in today.  He is, darn.  Need to start work on the
        draft due this afternoon.

8:15    Read electronic mail.

8:20    Delete mail from students taking CMPSC201 regarding questions
        about the class.  Hate your TA job. Depression:  too much
        work to do today.

9:00    For jump-start:  go to Pepsi machine.

9:05    Kick Pepsi machine; promise yourself to call up the company
        and ask for your money back.  Wonder why they would believe you.

9:33    Start printing out loads of stuff that may be vaguely related to
        your work.

9:41    Early morning stupefaction.  Mutter racist comments to yourself
        about your office mate.

9:43    Curse your office mate in a low tone he would not comprehend.
        Feel good about him not grasping English well.

9:58    Finger everyone in the department and most people half way

         need & and kinda make him aware you are working hard on your
         project.

11:05    Perverted daydreams.

11:11    Read electronic news.  Midmorning yawn time.

11:34    Start typing junk at a very high key-in rate to pretend
         you are working hard as your advisor passes by from outside.

11:35    Press the BackSpace key for one and a half minute until all
         the garbage you typed in is erased.  Realize that you can type
         more than 256 characters per half minute.

11:41    Flirt with the new girl in the department.

11:45    Print out some slides for afternoon's draft + presentation.

         bulk cola.

1:00     Group Meeting with advisor.
1:14     Sudden awareness of one's shallowness.  Resentment towards foreign

         survey.

1:51     Advisor hands you the reddened copy of your draft for corrections.

1:51:02   The 49 second urge to murder advisor begins!!

1:51:52   Realize that he controls your assistantship/grade/
          graduation possibility/graduation date/all job opportunities/
          and the rest of your life.

1:52:53   Thank him.

1:52:54   Thank yourself for not saying something stupid to your advisor.

1:53:00   Splitting headache #1.

1:59    Check electronic mail, don't reply though, you are too busy
        to do that.

        few .gif files.  Sharpen pencil.

3:06    Worry about never graduating.  Time to write a letter -- NOT!
        no time for that.  Rearrange desk.  Call up bank; see if you
        have any money.  Fear of losing aid next fall.  Read latex
        manuals to figure out how to put &$%&% in %$^% format.

3:43    Watch the clock.  Make plans to do a all-nighter tonight.  Vow to
        watch only 2 TV programs

4:58    Notice Advisor leave.

4:58:01   Sudden sense of freedom.  Go home for quick, short dinner break.

9:00    Come into the office.

9:01    The hard working grad student you are, you have to come to the

        office late at night to "get the work done."

9:03    Check electronic mail.  Decide it would be a good time to attack
        those ftp sites since network won't be loaded.  Run into "since
        network won't be loaded" traffic and get the pictures into your
        machine.  Compress all unwanted research/class directories to
        make space.  Back up all your pictures.

10:11    Admire pictures.  Begin work.  Realize you need references.
        Realize its too late today to go to the library.  Sudden feeling
        of having wasted the day.

10:49    Sudden feeling of possibly having to waste the night.  Decide to
        turn in early and come back very early tomorrow morning.  Decide
        to play a Tetris on the system to put yourself in a good mood.

11:15    Play game after game after game to improve your score and get on
        the scoreboard.  Realize that your office mate is still at number
        6, two notches above you on the scoreboard.

12:20    Play until you beat your office mate into the 7th place.  A sense
        of achievement!!  Yes, today was not wasted!!  Return home to find
        your roommate watching David Letterman reruns on NBC.  Tell him
        about the "hard working grad student day you had."  Discuss
        philosophy with roommate

1:09    Think about becoming a philosopher and dining with 4 others.
        (The Dining Philosophers problem, hee hee :-)  (Comp Sci joke)

        Argue with him about politics, why people prefer Japanese
        cars and whether it is better to set the heat to "hot" or "cold"
        to defrost the windshields faster.

1:49    Realize neither of you have bought milk today.  Get reminded
        of the "too much milk problem"

2:04    Forget about getting up early.  Turn the phone ringer off and
        go to sleep.

        (repeat)

                      WHY GRADUATE STUDENTS ARE LIKE CATS

They are your friends if you feed them.
They talk to you and you can't understand what they are saying.
They tend to run amok in the apartment/house for no apparent reason in short
bursts of frenzy, followed by dormancy.
They can survive with a minimum of attention, but do like to be noticed and
praised every so often.
They are creatures of the night.
They follow instructions if they feel like it.
They can be soft and cuddly when they feel like it.
Cats barf hairballs, grad students barf highballs (and any other drink they
can consume to excess).
Food is very important to them.
Sleep is also very important to them.
Both can sleep or otherwise ignore you while you are talking to them.
Both hide when something big and noisy (vacuum cleaner or supervisor) comes
into their vicinity
They eat some of the most disgusting things (free food)
They can sleep just about anywhere
They have their own set of morals
They both like using the computer (cats for warmth)
They both could care less about (insert anything here)
They both get amazingly high on herb extracts
They both represent anarchy in its most creative form
They both show a general lack of respect for authority
You see them only at dinner hour
You get looks like "and you are?", "this concerns me how?", "am I under
arrest? can I go now?" ,and "duuuude!" from them at least once a day
The idea of movement horrifies them
They both tend to collapse in the middle of rooms due to alcohol and/or a
warm sunbeam.
They are both vomit machines

Recent Results in Theory of Computing - I

                     "The Halting Problem is Solvable"

A fundamental question in the graduate computer science curriculum can be
posed as follows: Given an average grad student doing a Ph.D, will the
student ever complete his dissertation? This problem has been termed the
"Halting Problem," and it has been an open problem thus far. In the
following, we show that the halting problem is solvable. Furthermore, the
problem can be solved within the time stipulated by the Graduate College
for Ph.Ds or, in the worst case, with only a constant number of petitions
for extensions.

The halting problem was first formulated by Alan Turing, who observed a
number of his graduate students being apparently busy all the time but
never graduating. Turing tried to solve the problem by first stopping all
assistantships after the sixth year and then by purging all games from the
research computers. Needless to say, his efforts were fruitless. Later,
Church almost succeeded in solving the problem when he placed notices in
grad students' mailboxes indicating attractive jobs in industry with
several orders of magnitude higher remuneration. The so called Church's
thesis was that the halting problem is solvable, given enough financial
motivation. Church's idea backfired when grads found out that they have to
actually work to earn money in the outside world. Thus, far from solving
the halting problem, Church aggravated it (After this, we are not sure
whether Church himself graduated). Recently, Cook et al have shown that the
halting problem falls under a new complexity class, "NP Hairy." (NP hairy
is the class of hopelessly complicated problems with no known solutions.
The hardest problem in NP hairy has been shown to be the problem of trying
to claim standard deductions in the 1040 form).

In the following, we show that the halting problem is indeed solvable. For
this, we assume the existence of a "Super Grad," who is capable of working
in any area in CS (except possibly numerical analysis). For notational
convenience, we call this super grad, S sub G sup i,j sub * (written using
a funky theoretical CS font). The property of Super grad is that, given the
description of any grad (mostly in terms of the number of newsfiles he/she
reads every day) and a description of his/her thesis topic, Super grad will
either halt with a dissertation or keep publishing technical reports
indefinitely. Now, we give Super grad a description of himself and his own
thesis topic. If Super grad halts, we are done (and so is he) otherwise we
get a stream of technical reports. But by the "fundamental research
theorem" of CS Departments (refer to the graduate study manual) any five
arbitrary technical reports on unrelated topics can be compiled into a Ph.D
thesis. Thus, we are done in the second case too.

Finally, how long does it take for a dissertation to be completed? The time
is either less than or equal to the duration allowed by the Grad College
for the completion of a Ph.D or it is greater. In the latter case, infinite
number of petitions can be filed for extensions. Since the Grad College
never remembers previous petitions, the total number of petitions received
by the Grad College is always one, a small constant. (QED)

Q: Why is the thesis of a doctoral degree worse than the thesis of a master
degree?
A: Because the theses for a doctoral degree are written by students of
masters, but theses for a doctoral degree - by doctors.

A grad student, a post-doc, and a professor are walking through a city
park and they find an antique oil lamp.  They rub it and a Genie comes
out in a puff of smoke.

The Genie says, "I usually only grant three wishes, so I'll give each of
you just one."

"Me first!  Me first!" says the grad student.  "I want to be in the
Bahamas, driving a speedboat with a gorgeous woman who sunbathes
topless."  Poof!  He's gone.

"Me next!  Me next!" says the post-doc.  "I want to be in Hawaii,
relaxing on the beach with a professional hula dancer on one side and a
Mai Tai on the other."  Poof!  He's gone.

"You're next," the Genie says to the professor.

The professor says, "I want those guys back in the lab after lunch."

While it is true that William Shakespeare was an extremely prolific
playwright and is known the world over for his keen insights into the human
condition, it is a much lesser known fact that Bill was also a graduate
student in the Department of Alchemy at the University of Avon (home of the
"Fighting Lip Balms" football team).  His experiences in science have lead
to graduate school references in a number of his plays, as indicated below.

"My friends were poor but honest."
  - All's well that ends well, act I, scene ii.
"Oft expectations fail, and most oft there where most it promises."
  - All's well that ends well, act II, scene i.
"The little foolery that wise men have makes a great show."
  - As you like it, act I, scene ii.
"My pride fell with my fortunes."
  - ibid.
"A wretched soul, bruised with adversity."
  - A comedy of errors, act II, scene i.
"Some griefs are medicinable."
  - Cymbeline, act II, scene ii (originally linked with the line "Get thee
to a med school." which was later adapted for Hamlet.)

             CONFIDENTIAL GUIDELINES FOR A PHD THESIS DEFENSE
                                                    By  Godfried Bomans

Such a thesis defense, it gladdens me.  I sit there as promotor, hugging
myself in glee.  Because naturally there has to be opposed.  In the first
place, I do that myself. The matter is save.  I won't say more, as this
book will also fall into the hands of the less educated.  In the second
place, others do this.  The law it says that everybody may do this, even
the cleaning woman of the building, but in practice not much comes of that.
As a rule the practice is limited to professors of the own or adjoining
faculties.  And there are some dirty customers between them.  My advise to
the promovendus is, to bent forward observantly and ask smiling *this*
question: 'What does the esteemed opponent mean?'  Than he is
stuck. Because what does this question imply?

For starters, that what he is saying *now*, is in any case gibberish.  And
because that is usually true, you already reached *that*.  But there is
more.  Because the question, that the man had constructed the night before
in bed, has to be rigged up again.  In the case he succeeds (which rarely
happens), there is still no case for panic.  You *keep* smiling, but this
time with compassion, tempered by respect.  Especially the last is
important, because you may not infuriate the guys.  In their anger they
might rap out something sensible and then we are in real trouble.  What to
do now.  I will tell, despite that it is really a waste.  You remark,
tilting your head a little to show that the blunder hurts you yourself, the
following: 'As you know Nudelman already anticipated this contention in
1903'.  I would not go before 1903.  Put it in the nineteenth century and
it becomes too big.  'Already in 1903' is bitter enough.  Prof. Nudelmann
does not exist naturally, no more than the book you refer to.  I will
explain later how important this is.  Because what must your opponent do
now?

He can say, that he never read Nudelmann.  Then he is a goner immediately.
You show this with a movement of your hand to the Academic Senate and sit
down.  The man will reach his pension, but as a professor he can forget it.
He can also say, that of course he knows Nudelmann but not *this*
particular passage.  This is also weak.  People should master Nudelmann
completely.  Half science is charlantanry.  He can also say, that of course
he knows the pronouncement, but is of a different opionion.  That is a
dangerous game. And that *must* go wrong.  Who disagrees with an author,
about one did not even know the existence will undoubtly ride into a hole.
You can confidently leave that to him.  On his every assertment, you
answer: 'Exactly, exactly, continue just a bit longer, because that is
exactly the chain of reasoning, Nudelmann had in mind.'  And nothing is as
unnerving as encouraging nonsense. It will sap the strongest.

But your opponent is wiser.  As soon as you utter 1903, he will declare
himself 'completely satisfied' and sit down.  Yeah, he will risk his cap,
just for the pleasure of endangering yours.  He may be a professor, but he
is is also the provider for his family.  Take care, that afterwards, during
the reception, you go to him and thank him for his remark, which gave you
something to think about *anyway*.  Stare into your sherry and move away
pondering, as if you had been revealed a vision.  There is even nothing
against agreeing, the was was really in the right. He is no longer a
danger.

168) "I say Hallelujah, brothers and sisters!"
169) Claim political asylum.
170) Traffic reports every 10 minutes on the 1's.
171) Introduce the "Eyewitness Thesis Team". Near the end of your talk, cut
        to Jim with sports and Alison with the weather.
172) Live radio and TV coverage.
173) Hang a sign that says "Thank you for not asking questions"
174) Bring a microphone. Point it at the questioner, talk-show style.
175) Use a TelePromTer
176) "Take my wife - please!"
177) Refuse to answer questions unless they phrase the question as a limerick.
178) Have everyone bring wine glasses. When they clink the glasses with a
        spoon, you have to kiss your thesis. Or your advisor.
179) Offer a toast.
180) Firewalk.
181) Start giving your presentation 15 minutes early.
182) Play drinking thesis games. Drink for each overhead. Drink for each
        question. Chug for each awkward pause. This goes for the audience
        as well.
183) Swoop in with a cape and tights, Superman style.
184) "By the power of Greyskull..."

188) Hold a raffle.
189) "You think this defense was bad? Let me read this list to show you
        what I COULD have done..."

(FINAL NOTE: Depending on the subject of your thesis, some of these things,
such as tap dance, virtual reality, or reading from the Book of Mormon
might be entirely appropriate, of course.)

(FINAL FINAL NOTE: Circulate this list freely if you'd like, but please
remember to credit Peter, Jim, and Alison as the major authors.)

The graduate student's prayer (with apologies)

Our professor, who art in tenure,
Hallowed by thy grant.
Thy method come.  They experiment be done,
in lab as it is in textbooks.
Give us this day, our daily enzyme.
And forgive us our contamination,
as we forgive our collaborators.
And lead us not into chemistry,
but deliver us from physics:
For thine is the laboratory, and the method,
and the glory, for ever.
Amen.

                             A DAY IN THE LIFE
Damn. 5:30 am. Time to get out of bed. Ah, I really don't need to get up
yet. I'll just snooze for a few more minutes. Dreaming now. I'm standing at
a conveyor belt and stamping the lids onto bottles. Stamp, stamp, stamp.
Boss is looming over me. Wants to see me in the office. No I'm on a stage
receiving the Nobel Prize. For what? What did I do? Rinnnnnnnnnng. Whew.
12:00 noon. That was an awful dream. Sure glad I don't work in a place like
that. You know, I sort of feel like baking some bread for breakfast this
morning. All I need to do is buy som flour and ... AH CRAP!! Broke again. I
forgot I blew all that money on photocopying yesterday. Ah well, Kraft
dinner sounds good...

Whow I'm at work before 3 pm today. I've got to stop being so hard on
myself like this. Wait a second - where is everybody? There isn't a soul
around here! Oh yeah! There's a seminar at 3! What does this notice say
about it? Yikes, who would go to listen to this talk? It sounds so *dull*.
Let's see here - yep, there's coffe and donuts served. That explains it.
I'm too late for it, so what shall I do? I know! I can do some computer
work! There has got to be a video game high score to break somewhere!

Okay, It's 6 pm. Perhaps I should go home and relax. Ah, alright, I'll
check yesterdays experiments.
OH MY GOD! I DON'T BELIEVE IT! THIS CAN'T BE TRUE! EVERYBODY WILL BE
OVERWHELMED WITH AMAZEMENT! The experiments failed again. Should have
guessed so. I tell you, someday that distilled water is going to have to be
tested. It really is wreaking havoc with my science...

Alright. Time to go home an do some reading. I always find it more
productive to read my journals at home in a relaxed environment, away from
the pressures of the lab. Let's see here. "The journal of Chemical
Biology". Nah. How about "The Biological Chemistry Journal". Read it. Okay
here's something new: "The Biological Journal of Chemistry". Yeah, this is
it. Wow, first paragraph and I'm lost. Feeling sleepy ... stay awake ...
can't ... Zzzzzzzzzz.

8 pm. A day of grad school concludes.
                                    (Not Andy Green's, however)

Leaning Underground Electronic Networks of Whiners, Pulers, and others who
should be spending more time at the lab bench (L.L.U.E.N.o.W.P.&O.  aka YSN,

who secretly wish to be tenured research professors)

From: hjiwa@nor.chevron.com
   I've no idea how true it is or if it's an Urban Legend.  This guy was
taking an exam in Trinity College here (old college, about 400 years old).
In the middle of the exam, he called a proctor and requested his pint of
ale.  The proctor, of course, just looked at him.
   Our hero then produced a copy of the *old* regulations which stipulated
that a gentleman was entitled to this type of refreshment.  The proctor
then reported to the college officials, who verified the existence of just
such a regulation.  The student was granted his one pint of beer ten
minutes before the end of the exam, and kicked back and drank his beer
while the other examinees frantically scrambled to finish the exam.
   The college authorities, fearing more expensive and disruptive episodes
in the future, checked the college regulations.  They then provided our man
with his glass of ale, but promptly fined him for not wearing his
ceremonial sword and shield to the examination.
___________________________________________________________________________
This is true, told to me by a chemistry professor at Idaho State
University.

The professor had the following as an extra credit question on an exam:

An age-old question is "How many angels can dance on the head of a pin?"
Answer that question given the following:

   Each angel requires an area equal to a circle with a diameter the size of a
gold atom in which to dance.
   The pin in question has a head which is a circular plane with a diameter of
0.5 mm.

Make any other assumptions necessary to solve the problem.

The professor was sorry to admit that he had to give full credit to the
following answer:

I assume that angels do not exist.
The answer is 0.

ELECTRONICS STUDENT IN AN INTERVIEW

Interviewer:  Why is a thicker conductor necessary to carry a current
              in A.C. as compared to D.C.?
Candidate:    An AC current goes up and down (drawing a sinusoid)
              and requires more space inside the wire, so the wire has
              to be thicker.

Interviewer:  How will you tell if that wall outlet carries AC or DC?
Candidate:    I will put my finger in.  If it is pushed away, it is DC.
              If it gets stuck, it was AC.

Interviewer:  How will you reverse direction of an induction motor?
Candidate:    I will remove the four bolts at the base, turn the motor
              around, and put back the bolts.

Interviewer:  How do you start a synchronous motor?
Candidate:    Vrrrrrrrmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm  (in rising pitch)
Interviewer:  Stop!  Stop!
Candidate:    rrrrrrrmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm  (in falling pitch)

Interviewer:  How do you limit surge current within an integrated
circuit?
Candidate:    By using a miniature circuit breaker.

External (to student):  Why does a capacitor block DC but allow AC
                        to pass through?

Student:      See, a capacitor is like this   ---| |--- , OK.
              DC Comes straight, like this ----------, and the capacitor
              stops it.  But AC, goes UP, DOWN, Up DOWN and jumps right
              over the capacitor!"

Examiner:               "What is a step-up transformer?"
Student:                "A transformer that is put on top of electric
                         poles."
Examiner (smiling):     "And then what is a step-down transformer?"
Student (hesitantly):   "Uh -- A transfomer that is put in the basement
                         or in a pit?"
Examiner (pouncing):    "Then what do you call a transformer that is
                         installed on the ground?"
(Student knows he is caught -- can't answer)
Examiner (impatiently):  "Well?"
Student (triumphantly):  "A stepless transformer, sir!"

JONATHAN LETHEM'S LATEST

From:  Jonathan Lethem's really quite wonderful new novel, _As She
Climbed Across the Table_ (Doubleday, 1997: ISBN 0-385-48517-4).

.....I looked at the clock.  I'd slept all night and morning, through
most of the last meeting of my freshman class.

I struggled back into my preworn clothing, my pretied shoes, ran to the
anthropology building, and rushed upstairs to the airless classroom.
Only one of my sixteen students remained.  He sat alone at his desk,
writing in his notebook with a ballpoint pen.  He looked up, astonished
at my arrival.

"Professor Engstrand."

"Angus."

"I'm almost done."

"Done with what?  Where did they all go?"

He blinked twice.  He looked frightened.

"Tell me what happened, Angus."

"We met and waited for you, sir.  Sat in our places.  But you didn't
come.  No one said anything.  Half an hour passed.  Then someone
suggested that your absence might represent some new form of final
exam.  Some arcane and menacing form, I believe those were the exact
words.  We laughed nervously at first.  But one by one we opened our
notebooks.  Began attempting to answer the question you were posing.
That's why it's a little unsettling to see you here, sir.  I was almost
finished.  The others handed in their papers to the department
secretary.  May I ask you a question, sir?"

"Yes, Angus."

"Does this mean I failed?"

"No, Angus.  There's no time limit.  Hand it in when you're done."

I was also told this about happening at my college.  We'll see how many
schools have had the same story repeated there.  8)  In one of the houses
in which all the lacrosse/fortball players live they have a file of papers
for classes so people don't have to write them, they can just take a paper
previously written and change the name and hand it in.  Well, there was one
paper for a class which someone had written and gotten a B on.  But on the
corner of the front page was a little drawing of a whale.  The next year a
brother" took the class (we don't have frats on campus.  This is as close
as we get) and when he had to do the paper he just xeroxed the paper and got
a B on it as well.  Then the next time the class was offered another brother
took the paper and xeroxed it, but whited out the whale so the prof wouldn't
suspect that it was the same paper etc.  Well, he got a C on it.  When he
asked the prof why he got a C on it, when all the other people who copied the
paper got a B on it and he got a C and it was the same paper, the prof said
I liked the whale."

                       STUDENT RAISE OF GRADE FORM

 Dear Professor:_________________________________________Date:_______________

     My grade in __________________________ should be raised from __________
 to ______ because:

 1.  There must be a mistake somewhere.
 2.  I was not well at the time of the examination.
 3.  My mind always goes blank during an examination.
 4.  This mark ruined my prospect of getting a scholarship.
 5.  This is the only course in which I received a poor grade
 6.  This mark grieved my mother (or Father). whose pride I am.
 7.  Conditions in the room were not conductive to concentration.
 8.  The examination was unfair and unfairly distributed over the
subject
 9.  I have to work after school and nights; therefore I should be
given a break.
 10. I am married; therefore, I should be given a break.
 11. I would have done much better if I had taken the examination give
to one of the other sections.
 12. Several people around me copied from my paper during the
examination yet they received higher marks than I did. Surely this is
not fair.
 13. The reason I did not do better is because I am very honest. I do
no wish to say anything against any other members of the class.
 14. I know many of the class members who do not work as hard as I do
an who got a better grade. I am recognized among my classmates as a
good student - you just ask any one of them.
 15. The question were ambiguous, and therefore, my answers should be
graded according to the reasonable interpretations that I made of your
questions.
 16. Many of the questions could not be answered with straight facts;
they were matters of opinion. I do not believe I should be penalize
just because my opinions differ from those of the instructor.
 17. I have studied this subject from the broad philosophical
viewpoint and therefore, I was unable to answer your technical-based
question
 18. I am philosophically oriented to the realm of ideas; I respond to
the sweep and scope of great intellects. My work is beyond the
interest in petty details and parrot-like memorizing of those who are
merely students
 19. At the time of the exam, I was suffering from a severe case of
cognitive dissonance and was incapable of coping with the stress of
the hour.
 20. It is not a higher mark I seek; I care nothing about marks; I
think marks are wicked and I disapprove of them. However, this
pernicious system of which I am a victim requires marks for achieving
success and therefore, I seek a higher mark.

Here is a list of the ways professors here at the American University grade
their final exams:

Dept Of Statistics:
All grades are plotted along the normal bell curve.

Dept Of Psychology:
Students are asked to blot ink in their exam books, close them and turn them in.
The professor opens the books and assigns the first grade that comes to mind.

Dept Of History:
All students get the same grade they got last year.

Dept Of Religion:
Grade is determined by God.

Dept Of Philosophy:
What is a grade?

Law School:
Students are asked to defend their position of why they should receive an A.

Dept Of Mathematics:
Grades are variable.

Dept Of Logic:
If and only if the student is present for the final and the student has
accumulated a passing grade then the student will receive an A else the student
will not receive an A.

Dept Of Computer Science:
Random number generator determines grade.

Music Department:
Each student must figure out his grade by listening to the instructor play the
corresponding note (+ and - would be sharp and flat respectively).

Dept Of Physical Education:
Everybody gets an A.

A professor was giving a big test one day to his students. He handed out
all of the tests and went back to his desk to wait.  Once the test was over
the students all handed the tests back in. The professor noticed that one
of the students had attached a $100 bill to his test with a note saying "A
dollar per point."

The next class the professor handed the tests back out. This student got
back his test and $64 change....

Reading Comprehension

Read the following carefully and answer the questions below.

In addition to the obvious effects of solar activity on the upper atmosphere,
some scientists contend that it also affects the weather.  These contentions,
however, are for the most part unconfirmed and some are very dubious.  Even
further afield, a British researcher on epidemiology claimed last year that "the
periods of world dominance of successive major subtypes of influenza A virus
have synchronized closely with the periodicity of sunspots."  Correlatons of
biomedical phenomenon with solar activity, such as this one, are generally not
taken seriously by most Western scientists.  Many researchers in the Soviet
Union, however, do believe in such possibilities, including even a correlation
of sunspots with outbreaks of plague-spreading rodents in central Asia.

1.  In what lanuage is the British researcher speaking?
    a. Japanese   b. Urdu   c. Bengali   d. British   e. Media

2.  The term "most Western" means
    a. Hawaii   b. John Ford's longest film   c. nothing   d. correct

3.  A conclusion that could be drawn from this passage is
    a. Russian scientists are idiots and Russia is full of rats
    b. The sun has sunspots
    c. Don't ask a question of a British researcher if you want an answer
    d. all of the above

    Grover?
    a. 0%   b. 100%   c. a and b   d. a only   e. b only

3.  Delbert McBumm wants to pawn a hundred-dollar watch.  The pawnbroker gives
    him eleven dollars for it and then sells it for a hundred and twenty-five.
    What was the relative rate of mark-up in the watch in relation to half of
    its worth, if the worth is calculated at three-quarters the difference
    between the pawnbrokers's offer and 78% of Delbert's assessment of the
    watch's value?
    a. 100   b. 50   c. 75   d. 115   e. none of the above

                                           /\50 6/\

50 Fun Things To Do In A Final That Does Not Matter

(i. e.  you are going to fail the class completely no matter what you get
on the final exam)


1. Bring a pillow.  Fall asleep (or pretend to) until the last 15
minutes.  Wake up, say "oh geez, better get cracking" and do some
gibberish work.  Turn it in a few minutes early.

2. Get a copy of the exam, run out screaming "Andre, Andre, I've got the
secret documents!!"

3. If it is a math/science exam, answer in essay form.  If it is long
answer/essay form, answer with numbers and symbols.  Be creative.  Use the
integral symbol.

4. Make paper airplanes out of the exam.  Aim them at the instructor's
left nostril.

5. Talk the entire way through the exam.  Read questions aloud, debate
your answers with yourself out loud.  If asked to stop, yell out, "I'm
SOOO sure you can hear me thinking. " Then start talking about what a jerk
the instructor is.

6. Bring cheerleaders.

7. Walk in, get the exam, sit down.  About five minutes into it, loudly

you? Where's the regular guy?"

8. Bring a Game Boy (or Game Gear, etc. . . ).  Play with the volume at max
level.

From: Chris N BJerke <chris_b50@hotmail.com>

When I was taking physics one of the students thought it would help to try
and pay for points on the mid-term.  He paper clipped a $100 bill and a
note that read $1 a point to his mid-term before handing it in.  The
following week when we got the papers back the prof had returned his paper
with $61 changs and a note that read 'Thanks'
___________________________________________________________________________
The setting is Ohio State University about six or seven years ago in a huge
lecture hall (approximately 1000 students) for a Calculus final.
Apparently this particular calculus teacher wasn't very well liked.  He was
one of those guys who would stand at the front of the class and yell out
how much time was remaining before the end of a test, a real charmer. Since
he was so busy gallivanting around the room making sure that nobody cheated
and that everyone was aware of how much time they had left before their
failure on the test was complete, he had the students stack the completed
tests on the huge podium at the front of the room. This made for quite a
mess, remember there were 1000 students in the class.

During this particular final, one guy entered the test needing a decent
grade to pass the class. His only problem with Calculus was that he did
poorly when rushed, and this guy standing in the front of the room barking
out how much time was left before the tests had to be handed in didn't help
him at all. He figured he wanted to assure himself of a good grade, so he
hardly flinched when the professor said "pencils down and submit your
Scantron sheets and work to piles at the front of the room".

Five minutes turned into ten, ten into twenty, twenty into forty... almost
an hour after the test was "officially over", our friend finally put down
his pencil, gathered up his work, and headed to the front of the hall to
submit his final. The whole time, the professor sat at the front of the
room, strangely waiting for the student to complete his exam.

"What do you think you're doing?" the professor asked as the student stood
in front of him about to put down his exam on one of the neatly stacked
piles of exams (the professor had plenty of time to stack the mountain of
papers while he waited) It was clear that the professor had waited only to
give the student a hard time.

"Turning in my exam," retorted the student confidently. "I'm afraid I have
some bad news for you," the professor gloated, "Your exam is an hour
late. You've failed it and, consequently, I'll see you next term when you
repeat my course." The student smiled slyly and asked the professor "Do you
know who I am?"

"What?" replied the professor gruffly, annoyed that the student showed no
sign of emotion.

The student rephrased the question mockingly, "Do you know what my name
is?"

"No", snarled the professor.

The student looked the professor dead in the eyes and said slowly, "I
didn't think so", as he lifted up one of the stacks half way, shoved his
test neatly into the center of the stack, let the stack fall burying his
test in the middle, turned around, and walked casually out of the huge
lecture hall.

From: "Mr  Funny  Bone  International"

It had been 4 hard, gruelling years of computer science courses for John,
but the end was in sight, with only one more semester before graduation.
However, he realized he still needed one more general science class to
fulfil his graduation requirements. Rushing to register, he found the only
course still available was on "Birds and their habitats".  Reluctantly,
John signed up.

Like many elective courses at the university, the class was large, and
generally taught by one of the professor's assistants. As the semester
continued, the work load increased, and he found himself spending more and
more time studying birds.  To make matters worst, the professor offered
only one test at the end of the semester to determine each students grade -
It was all-or- nothing.  Two weeks prior to the final, John began cramming
and re-reading the class books and his notes.  As he walked in to the exam
room, he was confident that he would not only pass but would fly through
the test with little effort.

As John began the final, he discovered that each question cantered around a
picture of... a pair of bird legs.  He was to identify each bird by its
legs, and then answer the corresponding question.  He could not believe it
- he had studied so hard, and it all came down to his ability to identify
birds by their LEGS? He answered best he could, but after struggling with
the test for over an hour, John marched down to the front where the
professor of the class was standing and slammed the test down into the pile
of other exam books.

"This is the sorriest class and you are the worst professor on this
campus."

As he started out the door the shocked professor yelled back, "What is your
name, young man?"

John turned, pulled up his pants legs, held his bare leg in the air, and
replied,

"You're so smart, you figure it out!"

A student comes to a young professor's office hours. She glances down
the hall, closes his door, kneels pleadingly. "I would do anything to
pass this exam." She leans closer to him, flips back her hair, gazes
meaningfully into his eyes. "I mean..." she whispers, "... I would
do... anything."

He returns her gaze. "Anything?"

"Anything."

His voice turns to a whisper. "Would you... study?"

A Girl's Guide to Geek Guys By Mikki Halpin and Victoria Maat

So, your crush on the bass player from Vibrating Sandbox has finally died a
whimpering death and you're wondering where to go from here.  All the
sinister dudes are either dating a series of interchangeable high-school
riot girls in baby doll dresses and an overdose of manic panic, or
permanently shacked up with some bitter old lady who pays all the bills.
Which will it be, a wifely prison or a humiliating one night stand?  Into
this void of potential mates comes a man you may not have considered
before, a man of substance, quietude and stability, a cerebral creature
with a culture all his own.  In short, a geek.

    Why Geek Dudes Rule

    They are generally available.

    Other women will tend not to steal them.

    They can fix things.

    Your parents will love them.

    They're smart.

Where The Geek Dude Lurks

While they are often into alternative music, geek dudes tend not to go to
shows too often.  Instead you'll find them hanging out with their friends,
discussing the latest hardware revolution or perfecting their Bill Gates
impressions.  You know how some people wear t-shirts with their favorite
bands on them, thus showing that they went to certain shows?  Well, geek
dudes wear t-shirts with the logos of different software companies on them,
thus showing that they are up on the latest, um, releases.  A small, though
convivial, rivalry may be detected here amongst the geek dudes.  Try
wearing one yourself and see if he strikes up a conversation.

Of course the best way to meet a geek dude is through the Internet.  All
geeks harbor a secret fantasy about meeting some girl in cyberspace,
carrying on an e-mail romance in which he has the chance to combine an
activity he is comfortable with, computing, with one he is very
uncomfortable with, socializing.  To many geek dudes, cyberdating is just
an advanced form of some kind of video game, but they are frustrated by a
lack of players.  Their lack is your strength.

Imprinting

You might notice that these men harbor some strange ideas about how the
world works and some particularly strange ideas about women.  There is a
reason for this.  Because they've had limited interpersonal experience,
geek dudes must look elsewhere for behavior models.  Lacking a real world
social milieu, geeks often go through a transference stage with such
narratives, and try to model their interactions on them.  Thus, certain
media images and themes come to have an overly cathected, metaphorized
reality to them, while the rest of us view such programming as mere
entertainment.  Case in point, our next topic...

The Trek factor

If you're not up on your Star Trek, you can forget about getting or keeping
a geek dude.  And I'm not just talking vintage-era Captain Kirk and Spock
either.  You've got to be up on your The Next Generation, your Deep Space
Nine, your Babylon 5.  Armed with your own knowledge of Federation
policies, you can better gauge when and how to act.  The sexual politics of
Star Trek are pretty blunt: the men run the technology and the ship, and
the women are caretakers (a doctor and a counselor).  Note the sexual
tensions on the bridge of the Enterprise: the women, in skin tight
uniforms, and with luxuriant, flowing hair.  The men, often balding, and
sporting some sort of permanently attached computer auxiliary.  This world
metaphorizes the fantasies of the geek dude, who sees himself in the
geeky-but-heroic male officers and who secretly desires a sexy, smart,
Deanna or Bev to come along and deferentially accept him for who he is.  If
you are willing to accept that this is his starting point for reality, you
are ready for a geek relationship.

Once You've Nabbed Him

Of course, catching that geek guy is only half the battle.  Keeping him by
your side is another story altogether.  I was privileged to speak with Miss
Victoria Maat, who not only got herself a geek guy but was also clever
enough to marry him just a few short months ago.  She interrupted her
newlywed bliss to give us a few tips on the care and feeding of a geek man:

Geeks are sensitive and caring lovers and husbands.  If you can hang with
the techno-lifestyle, they make the best mates.  They are the most
attractive people, not flashy or hunky, but the kind who get cuter and more
alluring over time (I told you she was a newlywed).  Definitely give geeks
a chance.

Geek Cuisine

Geeks tend towards packaged, junk foods since they prefer to work and think
and aren't all that into cooking for themselves.  Make sure that your geek
understands that you are not merely a replicator, and provide him with home
cooked food.  A batch of chocolate chip cookies will let him know that you
love him.  You do have to monitor your geek for weight gain; however,
remember that most of their days are spent sitting and staring at a
monitor.

Geek Lifestyle

The geek dude has long work habits and tends to bring his work home with
him.  He seems permanently connected to his hard disk.  You must at least
appear interested in his work.  Generally, a solid understanding of the
computer is a must; if you cannot master this, you should at least be able
to talk the talk.  Remember most geeks are anal and they get stressed about
details which appear insignificant.  Be understanding, put on your best
Deanna Troi face (see above) and empathize.

To relax, geeks love to play the latest computer games.  Let him play Myst
or Chuck Yeager's Air Combat for hours if he wants to.  Act concerned if
he's stuck or has just been ambushed by three MiGs.  My geek loves to try
to help people on the Internet who say that they are stuck in Myst.  He
comes up with clever riddles instead of directing them point blank.  Geeks
also like to go to sci-fi and Japanese animated movies, again, a basically
harmless vent for your man.

Geek Buddies

Many geeks extend their work friendships into what they jokingly refer to
as RL (Real Life, also known as "that big room with the ceiling that is
sometimes blue and sometimes black with little lights").  The greatest
thing about your geek's buddies is that you can feel secure in setting them
up with your girlfriends.  They may feel awkward around females at first,
so don't overwhelm them.  In time they will come out of their shell and
realize that you are into the same things they are.

Post-It Note

I thank Victoria for the above advice.  I must say that when she read my
draft of the piece, before writing her section, she asked her husband which
one he thought she was more like, Deanna or Beverly.  Howard, the devil,
immediately replied that he had always thought Victoria was actually most
like Ensign Ro Laren, a cute character with a slight authority problem who
is always had trouble (this is fairly apt).  This exchange is interesting
for several reasons:

    Howard had already thought about who she was most like.

    He could summon up characters from seasons past with ease.

    Victoria actually knew who he meant.

    Folks, I think this marriage will last.

One Last Thing

Because they have been so abused and ignored by society, many geeks have
gone underground.  You may actually know some and just haven't noticed
them.  They often feel resentful, and misunderstood, and it is important to
realize this as you grow closer to them.  Don't ever try to force the
issue, or make crazy demands that he choose between his computer and you.
Remember, his computer has been there for him his whole life; you are a new
interloper he hasn't quite grasped yet.

                            MATH/PHYSICS VALENTINES


From: Mathew Gustafson <mgustafson@mail.techplus.com>
Remember those cheesy valentines you used to get when you were in
elementary school?  Well I give something similar to my Math Physics
students on Valentines day.  I tried it last year with good success and I
was hoping that I could get some more ideas for cards.  So it was
recommended that I tap some of the greatest minds around, which is why I'm
here. I'm not sure if anyone can help me, but if you have any more ideas or
suggestions I would be greatly appreciative.  Thanks in advance.

Mathew

The following is a list I have come up with already:
* You're one of the fundamental forces in my life.  Be my Valentine.
* You're the net force that makes my heart accelerate.  Be my Valentine.
* There's an attraction between us, I think its gravity.  Be my Valentine.
* You're so great they should name a constant after you.  Be my Valentine.
* We're like opposite charges.  Be my Valentine.

                                 LINE DANCING

As Valentines has just past, we thought that many of you would be totally
depressed by another year in front of a bar without a mate and offer this
little tidbit as a ray of hope in the darkness of your despair.  Below, we
have listed a series of opening lines for the question of what you do for a
living, should the need ever come up over drinks with a stranger.  We've
listed the Good with the Bad and please note which is which.

GOOD: 1) "I am a doctor at a nearby hospital."
  This is a great one as it doesn't distinguish between an MD and a PhD.
  Hopefully, the other party won't realize the difference until they've
  already been captivated by your innate wit and charm.

2) "I do research into human diseases."
  This one is pretty good as it implies an MD without directly saying so.
  If possible, try to specify the disorder or disease using catch phrases
  like cancer of heart disease but try to avoid disorders which are less
  appetising for the bar setting, while just as noble, such as colitis or
  anything sexually transmissable.

3) "I do research at the university."
  Not as good as the others but not too bad.  Implies a level of
  intelligence which may or may not be the case, as well as giving the
  possibility of being a professor.

BAD: 1) "I work at the university/hospital."
  Not terrible but leaves interpretation too open in that you may clean
  mildew off the walls and porcelain fixtures.  While this may be true, we
  want to save hobbies until later in the conversation.

2) "I'm a biochemist."
  This one is usually greeted with a blank stare, a moment of silence and
  the response "Oh... how interesting."  Typically, the other party will
  then decide to refresh their drink without offering to represh yours.
  Biochemistry is just to vague for them.  You would have been better off
  saying Pharmacist.

3) "I'm a scientist."
  What, are you crazy?!?  You never use this one as it causes instant
  panic.  The only time this should be used when you aren't interested in
  your companion and want to scare them off with the idea that you're a
  pocket-protectored, bridge-taped glasses, whiny, nasal-voiced nerd (which
  you may be for all I know).

Verily, I say unto you, marry not an engineer for the engineer is a strange
being possessed of many devils; yea, he speaketh eternally in parables,
which he calleth "formulas", and he wieldeth a big stick which he calleth a
slide rule, and he hath but one Bible...a handbook.

He talketh always of stresses and strains, and without end of
Thermodynamics.  He showeth always a serious aspect and seemeth not to know
how to smile; and he picketh his seat in the car by the springs therein and
not by the damsel beside him; neither does he know a waterfall except for
its power, nor the sunset except for her specific heat.

Always he carieth his books with him, and he entertaineth his

maiden with steam tables. Verily though his damsel expecteth chocolates,
when he calleth he openeth the packages to disclose samples of iron.

Yea, he holdeth his damsel's hand, but only to measure the friction, and
kisses but to test viscosity.  For in his eyes shineth a faraway look which
is neither love nor longing, but a vain attempt to recall a formula.

There is but one key dear to his heart, and that is the Tau Beta Pi key;
and one love letter for which he yearneth, and that an "A"; and when to his
damsel he writeth of love and signeth with crosses, mistake not these
symbols for kisses but rather for unknown quantities.

Even as a young boy he pulleth a girl's hair to test its elasticity, but as
a man he discovers different devices; for he would count the vibrations of
her heart strings and reckon her strength of materials; for he seeketh ever
to pursue the scientific investivations, and inscribeth his passion in a
formula; and his marriage is a simultaneous equation involving unknowns and
yielding diverse answers.

DEDICATION TO STEPHEN HAWKING:

      These jokes are dedicated to Stephen Hawking, one of the great minds
of science, for making the profound in theoretical physics within reach of
ordinary mortals like me.

      While in high school, I wanted to become a physicist someday and
passed the national science scholarship exam. But being in a developing
country didnt give me a bright future in science. I became a lawyer like 4
others in the family. I miss Physics very, very much and hope my daughter
will become a scientist.  I hope too that someone creative will create a
website for my science jokes, in the hope they will reach Mr. Hawking. I
used some of his theories for these jokes. To all of you - scientists, know
that from thousands of miles away, we admire and thank you for your
contributions to mankind but we do love to annoy you with these jokes
because we can never approximate your brilliance.

The farmer replies, "I'm trying to win a Nobel Prize."

Last year I founded the Institute of Fuzzy Science here at Caltech, as a
public service for scientists everywhere.  This was my original

several other bulletins if this one is successful.

                        New IFS Option

A new interdisciplinary option for graduate students has been instituted,
in collaboration with the nearby Institute of Fuzzy Science.  IFS, for
those who are not aware, is an institution to promote research in "unusual,
spooky, or just plain off-the-wall" areas of modern science, generally not
accepted by the mainstream of the academic community.  "We don't believe in
discouraging a researcher," IFS president C.P. Diem commented in a recent
interview, "just because 99% of the anal-retentive scientists in this
country believe that conservation of energy holds, or that natural gas is a
fossil fuel, or that antigravity is impossible.  It really annoys me when
people invoke buzzwords like General Relativity or Quantum Mechanics," he
added.  "Accepting things just because there is experimental evidence for
them is poor science.  After all, tomorrow we might all fall off the
surface of the earth into space.  Isn't it better to study what would
happen if we did?  IFS is here," he declared, "to handle the 'if's."

Until quite recently, IFS was a pure research institution, staffed mainly
by scientists who are extremely reluctant to give their names to reporters.
"We like to keep a low profile," said one IFS scientist, Dr. Mindy
E. Mouse.  "We've got funding here, we do essentially anything we want to,
and nobody bothers us.  Why rock the boat?"  Due to this general
philosophy, the decision to accept students was a controversial one.  The
doubters were convinced, however, by a recent sociology study performed by
an Institute physicist.  A handful of students were admitted, and fears
that they would bring unwelcome publicity were quickly put to rest.
Indeed, most of the students refused to admit that they'd gone to IFS at
all, even when confronted with copies of their diplomas.

The Institute of Fuzzy Science is not organized on a traditional basis.
"We don't like to divide things up by fields of study, here," Diem
explained.  "After all, half of us don't really know what field we're
working in, most of the time.  One of our best researchers recently thought
he'd developed a new cosmological model that had no need to invoke the
concept of gravity.  Unfortunately, the model did not actually work; but
with slight modifications, he was able to present it as a new Computer
Science algorithm.  Serendipitous finds like that are extremely common
here."  IFS is therefore divided into three departments based on degree of
fuzziness.  The largest department, holding around half of the Institute
scientists, is the Department of Slightly Fuzzy Science.  It is staffed
mainly by scientists attempting to prove unpopular or dated theories, or
trying to reproduce results observed once, late at night.  Another large
group in the department are known as the SWOTS, or Scientists Working
Outside Their Specialties.  "This is a time- honored tradition, precedented
by many famous scientists," laughed Diem.  "If a physical chemist wants to
perform medical testing, or a physicist to dabble in eugenics, who are we
to say no?"

The second department is the Department of Fairly Fuzzy Science.  Here,
Flat Earth proponents rub shoulders with conspiracy theorists and
parapsychologists, each working on their various research projects.  "It
gives us a real feeling of freedom," mentioned one worker in the
department.  "I mean, mainstream science is just a result of the axioms
that you choose.  If you choose different axioms, it's amazing what you can
prove."  Another researcher agreed: "Basically, we just chuck out modern
theory and start over."  However, both the Departments of Slightly and
Fairly Fuzzy Science tend to be cautious in assessing the results of the
third and smallest department, the Department of Extremely Fuzzy Science,
which is dominated by creation scientists and supply-side economists.
"Frankly, they're so fuzzy even we don't believe it," admitted President
Diem.  "We don't let our students come into contact with the extremely
fuzzy scientists.  At least, not at first.  Young students tend to be very
impressionable; early exposure to extremely fuzzy studies tends to make
them what we call FTF: Far Too Fuzzy."

Though IFS supplies consultants both for Hollywood moviemakers and the
Department of Defense, many scientists feel that their work does not
receive the recognition it deserves.  "Take all this controversy over the
existence of magnetic monopoles," complained one IFS biologist.  "Why,
we've had half-a-dozen detections here, but no one has taken any notice.  I
myself detected two last week."  A conspiracy theorist offered his
explanation: "I think it's essentially because the Communist party controls
the government.  Since they depend on federal grants, most universities
lack the courage to accept results not dictated by the party line."  His
colleagues agreed, though they differed on whether is was Communists,
Fascists, Jews, or Catholics, or possibly an alliance of all four.

The new graduate option includes both a Master's program and a Doctorate of
Advanced Fuzzy Studies.  All interested students should contact the
Institute of Fuzzy Science directly, at their main office on Hollywood and
Vine.  Further bulletins on progress in the Fuzzy Sciences may be
forthcoming as new results are obtained.

                           SCIENCE OF THE FUTURE

      Anyone who has been on the net for more than a few days has had the
chance to run into a few of the people who populate nearly every newsgroup,
devoting their lives to the propagation of their particular theories on the
nature of the cosmos, theories such as "the space program is a hoax,"
"gravity doesn't really exist and the reason that people and their pets
don't fly off into space is because of a powerful electromagnetic reaction
that only I understand," "the earth used to orbit Saturn, resulting in
completely different physical laws that explain all the miracles described
in the Bible," "our DNA is really seven-dimensional and only by engaging in
special breathing exercises in my specially treated hot tub with a
pyramid-shaped cover can we learn to understand out higher
multi-dimensional spiritual nature," and so forth.  [Note: I am not making
any of these up.]

      These sorts of theories generally have three things in common: 1)
their truth is being actively suppressed by a conspiracy of mainstream
scientists, 2) future generations will know the truth and will be amazed at
how we could have been so stupid as to have questioned these obvious
truths, and 3) the authors of these theories have gained considerable
mastery of the use of the CAPS-LOCK key.

      Of course, knowing that in the future we will regard the authors of
these various theories with the same sort of reverent appreciation that we
now reserve only for those who have contributed the most to our science and
culture--Madonna, for example--has made me wonder, "just what will future
universities be saying about physics in years to come?"

      With this in mind, and with the benefit of reading several recent
articles that show a quantum mechanical basis for precognition, I decided
to attempt to channel just such a university physics course of the future.

      "Ohm...ohm...ohm...ohm...."  (Well, what else would you chant?)

#trance(ON) #trancemode(FUTURE | PHYSICS | CAPITAL_LETTERS)

      "Good morning, class, and welcome to the 2826 school year's first
session of 'Alternative Physics 201.'

      "Science, above all else, is based on evidence; it cares nothing for
what you personally like and don't like and, no matter what your personal
preferences are for how the universe ought to work, in the end, the theory
that best explains the evidence wins.  We can do experiments in the
present, but this is necessarilly a limited exercise, since experiments
performed today can only tell us what the laws of physics are like today.
Mainstream scientists tend to ignore this fundamental fact and, thus, are
hopelessly hamstrung by uniformitarian assumptions when trying to explain
events in the past, many of which simply don't fit with our current
physical theories.  Much better, then, would be if we could somehow find
out what the laws of physics really were in the past, and then use those to
explain past events.

      "Of course we can't just travel back in time and perform our
experiments back then--and, unfortunately, records from even a few
centuries ago are sparse and incomplete.  Back in the early twenty-first
century, all existing records were digitized and stored within the
capacious memory banks of the most powerful computer of all time, the
MegaloMainframe.  High-speed data links fed every remote computer in the
world, eliminating the need for local storage devices which soon vanished
from use.  Libraries became unnecessary with everything being instantly
available through the world-wide computer network that the MegaloMainframe
serviced; books became useful only as collectors' items.

      "Unfortunately, one day a careless user accidentally reformatted the
MegaloMainframe's main storage--and the Sysadmin mounted the backups and
entered the wrong command-line option to the backup program, erasing all of
the world's knowlege with a mistaken keystroke.  Few records survived the
ensuing chaos, and most of what we know of civilization before 2050 comes
from facts that the users of the MegaloMainframe thought were so important
that they printed them out and attached them to the walls of their places
of work--so great was the rioting and destruction that only a few sturdy,
fire-resistant office buildings remained and even these were ransacked by
looters who left little but those few bits of information that the people
of that era valued enough that they attached them reverently to the walls
of their work areas.

      "What can we learn from these past records?  Perhaps most exciting is
the knowlege that even the basic forces of nature were completely different
back then.  Gravity, for example, was far weaker than it is now, and on
smaller celestial bodies like the moon, it was so weak that pencils would
simply float away if released.  Yet, at the time, there was another force,
probably electromagnetic in nature, that held the planets together and kept
their inhabitants from flying off; lunar explorers used devices known as
"heavy boots" to hold themselves to the moon without need for gravity.

      "It appears that nuclear forces were also quite different in those
days, allowing the formation of many stable elements that are no longer
possible under our current physical laws.  While we may never know much
about many of these now-impossible elements and their properties, we know
from the surviving documents that one of the most important and widely used
of these was an element they called Administratium; another was a substance
called Thiotimoline, of which we know nothing at all save that, when
resublimated, it developed endochronic properties.

      "There remain many other mysteries that the ancients have left for us
to explain--what was the popular and powerful technique of chemical
analysis that nothing remains of but the name--the Roble Hall Purity Test?
What physical laws were there that allowed them to measure physical beauty
(in units called millihelens) by the action of boats?  Did the interaction
of gravity and the strange electromagnetic forces of their time permit
animals to communicate telepathically, as they are shown doing in the few
fragments we have found of their most prestigious scientific journal, the
"Far Side"?

      "Perhaps the one tidbit that most tantalizes us today is the knowlege
that the ancients understood the seemingly bizarre laws of physics they
lived under so well that the most famous scientist of their age, a man we
know only as "Murphy" was able to codify them all in a single grand unified
theory that bears his name.  Alas, no records of what "Murphy's Law" was
have yet been discovered, so we can only speculate upon whether this
pinnacle of twenty-first century knowlege would still apply to our world
today...."


      Unfortunately, my trance ended abruptly with an eerie, authoritarian
voice demanding that I insert two Trigannic Pu's for another three minutes;
then there was a click, and I was back in my ordinary, twentieth-century
bedroom.

      There you have it; it would seem that what we now think of as
crackpot ideas will be at least as enduring and well-accepted in the future
as our more conventional scientific theories, so the next time someone on
the net tells you that nuclear power is a hoax and the energy is actually
being produced by channelling the vibrational modes of the third of twelve
higher planes of existence, a fact being suppressed by greedy oil companies
who don't want you to discover that you can power your car safely and
without pollution merely by meditating on your five non-material chakras
which are contained in the higher-dimensional component of your DNA, the
existence of which is being suppressed by scientists who want to keep you
from learning your spiritual power, don't be quite so quick to dismiss it
without giving it the serious consideration it deserves.

                       (For us Europeans, The SI system) NUMBERS

If the metric system ever takes over we may have to say the following:

* A miss is as good as 1.6 kilometers.

* Put your best 0.3 of a meter forward.

* Spare the 5.03 meters and spoil the child.

* Give a man 2.5 centimeters and he'll take 1.6 kilometers.

METRIC SYSTEM -- WHY?

Dear Dr. Science,

I get sooo tired of hearing about the metric system.  Why doesn't the rest
of the world switch to the standard system??  After all, it is called the
STANDARD system

                                 -- Joel Kiesey, Mount Pleasant, IOWA

Foreigners are always trying to celebrate the abnormal, pretending that
it's exceptional and that's why they're charging more for it.  You could
have two bottles of an identical soft drink, one could be a quart, the
other two liters.  Guess which one they'd charge more for?  You guessed it
-- the second one because it was measured in liters, a metric unit.  Ask
yourself this, if the Creator had meant for us to measure distances in
meters, how come he gave us each two feet?  If you ask me, all this
pro-metric agitation is a ruse designed to distract us from our real
problems, like where to build the superconducting supercollider and what
really happened at Roswell.

In fact, the ISO metric alphabet (sic) is composed of 1 die-cast platinum
letter (the "bet"), which is housed in the basement of the ISO building in
Lausanne, just next to the kitty litter.  From this, a variety of
"______bets" can be constructed; the most popular being the "decabet" (100
letters) and the "kilobet" (1000 letters).  At present the "millibet"
(1/1000 letter) is significantly underused and a steering committee has
been started to try and improve this situation.

Please note that the prefix "alpha" is not a valid metric prefix, and as

such will be phased out in due time (maybe faster if the re-education camps
are successful).

We thank you for your interest in the metric system.

Here at work we are unfortunately required to use the nanobet, which

                  Ways Scientists Are Better Than Lawyers

We're trying to *simplify* the way the universe works.

A scientist has to kiss a judge's ass only when they're he's trouble.
Lawyers make a career out of it.

Cross a lawyer, she sues your ass; cross a scientist, and she infects you
with a slow, painful, deadly microbe she genetically engineered just for
you.

Naming planetoids after your girlfriend way cooler than naming them in a
suit.

Lawyers run out of bullshit no layman understands while scientists are just
barely getting warmed up.

Who do you think invented the Penis Enlargement formula?  Lawyers?

Scientists use a method that can bring about proven results.  Lawyers only
continue to practice.

When we use Latin phrases, we actually know what they mean.  Not only that,
we sometimes use Greek, just for fun.

Lawyers bill by the hour; scientists, by the nanosecond.

A scientist on the stand is an "expert witness."  Generally, a lawyer on
the stand is "the defendant."

Lawyers are bound by precedent. Scientists can simply write a new paper
saying Einstein was full of it, and start from scratch.

Scientists keep their hands in their own pockets, thankyouverymuch.

Them: Weak, girly-man Latin like "post ipso facto" Us: Manly, kick-ass
Latin like "Tyrannosaurus Rex"

In science, there eventually comes a point where fast talking and big words
aren't enough.

Them: The Client Us: Jurassic frickin' Park, Chester!

Unlike lawyers, less than 25% of scientists are pedophiles.

It takes *two* lawyers to destroy the world.

Being a scientist requires at least one human parent.

*Our* work with muck-sucking, bottom-dredging slime feeders has to pass
peer review.

Movies about a mad scientist taking over the world: dozens.  Movies about a
mad lawyer taking over the world: still waiting.

You can safely bend over around a scientist.

How many lawyers caught in freak work related accidents become superheroes?

535 scientists working together could solve the nation's problems.  535
lawyers working together caused the nation's problems.

    and the Number 1 Way Scientists Are Better Than Lawyers...

Scientists can understand lawyer jokes.

1997-08-05 Correctness Survey

Results: Reality -- Yes or No?

Our Scientific Correctness Survey in mini-AIR 1997-06 asked you to settle,
once and bureaucratically for all, the question, "Does reality Exist?"

We had 139 comprehensible responses. Of these, 42% believe reality exists,
while 31% believe it does not. From those who believe reality exists we
learn that it is "over priced", "over rated" and "a military secret." From
those who believe reality does not exist we learn that it "used to" and is
"all done with mirrors" (this last one from Ira Green, who may be willing
to show how it is done).

One person admits to being undecided, two voted both ways, four people feel
their reality exists but ours does not, and seven are agonizing over the
definitions of various words.

Frank Stephan says reality has existed since 1984. Stephan's conclusion is
based on the following quote, which he found in a public rest room:
"Reality is the Illusion which is caused by the absence of alcohol."

Dennis McClain-Furmanski believes reality can be tested by locking a
physicist and a cat in a box with two slits in it. He has a particular
physicist in mind but needs help getting said physicist into the box.

Catherine Armour asks if we consulted God. We are ashamed to admit that we
did not. However, we did hear from a descendent of Rene Descartes, who
said, "I think so." A contrasting view came from Fredrik Mansfeld, who
wrote:
	Behold this absolutely true statement: "Cogito, ergo sum."
	And reality doesn't think, I think.
	Hence, it does not exist.

Jim Livingston feels that "Reality exists when it is really necessary." Bob
Wakulich knows the answer but refuses to tell us.  Nigel Wilson "found
[reality] whilst sorting through some rubbish". Rosemary Webb told us "Yes,
but you can't get to it".  Carson Bays expressed a view held by many
readers: "Yes, except in New Jersey." Karem Lingel holds a variant of that
view, specifically that: "Reality exists in Ithaca, NY for about 30
minutes, 12 hours after a thunderstorm"

A few people apparently answered alternate questions. This included one
gentleman who stated "No. I was married to her ...  and I killed her", and
two "college students" who had the phrase "hardbodies" in their domain
name.  Karl Evan Hallowell justifies a NO answer thusly: "If reality
exists, then we mathematicians would have proven it by now."  Joe Kelley
reached the same conclusion, but by a different rout: "If reality existed
there would be a user manual."

More responses next month.

                    THE SECOND BOOK OF VECTOR


     There dwelt in the land of Brit certain high priests who served in the
temples of Elektron, which is an invisible god who darteth around in
ever-decreasing circles but never into his own nucleus. And the priests of
Elektron were devout men, serving no other god but he. And Elektron looked
with favour upon them and rewarded them each according to his worth with
divers strange gifts. To some he gave power to converse with those from
afar off and to others he brought visions of strange happenings in distant
lands; yeah, even of the United States cavalry in glorious Technicolor.

     And to certain other of his high priests Elektron gave powers of
levitation, so that they walked with their feet ever- so-slightly off the
ground; these dwelt in glass temples called, in the native tongue,
Researchlabs or Funnifarms, which were set apart from the common people and
to which entrance was denied to all, saving only those having scrips of
authority from their chief priest. And these priests were called by the
common people Egbonces which meaneth he who knoweth the square root of
minus one. And the Egbonces were cunning at fashioning curious devices from
boot-latchets and wax so that the populace were astonished and continually
cried out, saying, behold, these are great wonders but of what use be they?

     Yet other high priests of Elektron were followers of the prophet
Babbage and these were set in authority over divers machines that brought
much benefit to the common people; some computed the numbers of the tribes
and the taxes that each man should pay; others controlled the paycheks of
these that laboured, so that each man received less than his hire, while
others suggested that the inter-city chariots were tardy in arrival. And
Elektron taught the high priests to feed the engines with curious symbols
engraven upon tablets that they might print out likenesses of the
sex-goddess Bardot devoid of her apparel, which gave satisfaction to many.
And these priests likewise withdrew the hems of their garments from the
common populace and, by conversing in the alien tongues of Fortran and
Algol, preserved their mysteries jealously.

     At this time the skies were filled with heavier-than-air machines of
many nations which flew with the noise of emasculated hornets and carried
the peoples to and fro, even unto the ends of the earth. These machines
were under the auspices of the god Hijak. And certain of the nations had
air machines which could drop unpleasantness on the land beneath to
discomfort the people; but certain other nations who were poor and backward
and, as the saying goeth, not with it, did not possess these amenities.
Thus it came to pass that the acquisition of such machines was regarded by
all as an outward and visible sign that the possessor nation was emerging
from savage practices and an example to others.

     And certain rich merchants searched diligently and redeemed many
heavier-than-air machines; some from the knocker's yard; some which fell
from the back of an hangar and yet others which were dislodged privily from
the Science Museum. And they purposed to sell these to the heathen for many
shekels of gold and at great profit. So it came to pass that the merchants
sent envoys to a far country, even to the kingdom of Tsetse-Tsetse.

     And the envoys said unto the king of Tsetse-Tsetse, O king live for
ever but put not thy money upon it. And the king answered saying, What
meanest thou? Then did the envoys reply saying, Surely thou knowest that
they neighbour the king of Beri- Beri hath cast covetous eyes upon thy
lands and they maidens? If only thou hadst an Air Force it would cause
thine adversary to wind his neck in. Then did the king beat his breast
crying, Wo is me! And the envoys made reply saying Not so, O king, for it
so happeneth that we can supply thee with a squadron of Bleriot Mk.Is. And
thus it came to pass the king bought from the envoys for much fine gold and
slept peacefully with his wives that night.

     Then did the envoys depart and journeyed to the neighbouring land that
is called Beri-Beri. And they said to the king of Beri-Beri, O king live
for ever but begin not the reading of any long novels. And the king said
What meanest thou? Whereupon the envoys replied saying, Knowest thou not
that they neighbour the king of Tsetse-Tsetse hath secretly purchased
war-birds and purposeth to ravage thy country? At this the king went as
pale as was possible and the end of the matter was that he became Commodore
of a squadron of Cabbage White Mk. VIIs.

     And it came to pass that in Brit the god Elektron gave unto his high
priests the power to fashion magick bowls which could divine the presence
and movements of heavier-than-air machines even at great distances. Yeah,
and not only this, for by gazing into the bowl, vessels having their
business in great waters could be made to broach each other with greater
certainty. And on land its magick powers enabled the Fuzz to put the finger
upon all charioteers who, like their forbear Jehu, drove furiously. And the
name of this new wonder was radar, which, being translated, meaneth that
which worketh by suction and mirrors.

     And the rich merchants came unto the high priests of radar and said
unto them. Lo, we have heard much of the wonders that they god Elektron
hath taught thee and it seemeth that we can do a deal with profit to all.
Make for us great numbers of these magick bowls, we pray thee, that we may
sell them to the nations for their greater safety. Do this and we will pay
thee many shekels of gold; moreover, we will pull down thy temples to the
greater glory of Elektron, wherein thou shalt find all the instruments that
they heart desirest. And we will clothe thee in white raiment and give thee
charge over many. What sayest thou?

      And the high priest conferred privily and agreed among themselves
that they were on to a good thing. So it came to pass that the merchants
caused mighty temples to be built wherein the god Elektron might be served,
both by day and night; and the high priests, for their part, devised magick
bowls with ever greater cunning and these the merchants sold to whoever was
in the market place. Thus it came about that both the king of Tsetse-Tsetse
and the king of Beri-Beri were persuaded to buy the magick bowls with which
to keep vigil each upon the other. Yeah, both primary and secondary radar
had they in plenty and certain inhabitants of the two countries were
trained to interpret the signs and portents which appeared upon these bowls
whenever an heavier- than-air machine was drawing nigh.

     And behold, it came to pass that upon a certain night there was a
watchman in the kingdom of Tsetse-Tsetse who was an exceeding dim lamp;
moreover, when interpreting the symbols on the magick bowl, he was, as the
saying is, unable to tell Squawk from Clutter. And this watchman, fearful
of what he supposed he saw upon the face of the bowl, said unto himself The
enemy is upon us, and thereupon smote the Panick Button. Hereupon the
Bleriot Mk.Is rose (all excepting one which had broken its elastick band)
and brought destruction to the sleeping land of Beri-Beri. But the Cabbage
Whites, being forewarned by their magick bowls, were already riding the
heavens and bringing affliction upon their neighbours. And, by morning,
both countries were bathed in blood.

     And in the temples of Elektron there was great commotion, for the hot
lines were glowing red and the artificial moons which the high priests had
raised were overburdened with coloured images of the slaughter, for the
delectation of the common people. And when all was accomplished, overseers
from the United Nations came and wagged their heads and voted Tsetse-Tsetse
and Beri-Beri into their assemblies in recognition of their emergence.

             What the hell is Occam's Razor...and other stuff?

In article <9togdu$658$1@news.chatlink.com>,
 Spazzmodicus <Chazz@gohip.com> wrote:

> I've seen this listed one too many times now, I gotta' learn what Occam's

The Razor isn't a theory, it's a guideline for sorting out and
evaluating competing theories.

For example...

Say you left a lovely piece of cherry cheesecake in the refrigerator the
night before, and the next morning you go to have a little nibble and
find the entire thing missing. You immediately come up with two
hypotheses:

A) Your spouse/housemate/mother got up in the middle of the night and
beat you to it.

B) A transdimensional rift opened up in the crisper compartment, and a
swarm of miniature alien spacecraft came through it and absconded with
your dessert.

Occam's Razor says you should first try the simplest explanation, (A),
and go ask the other people in your house whether they ate the
cheesecake *before* you go to all the trouble of (B) wiring up your
fridge with video cameras, ion flux meters, and electromagnetic traps,
and etching platinum plates with teeny-tiny messages in symbolic
calculus.

Even if (A) gets proven false (you live alone) or accumulates
counter-evidence (they all deny it), Occam's Razor suggests that you
ought to first try hypotheses that don't require that you cobble up
unevidenced entities wholesale, like 'rifts' and 'miniature aliens'.

Sherlock Holmes' comment that "when you have eliminated the impossible,
whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth" is a related
but overstated corollary. The idea is that you should always evaluate
hypotheses by starting with the simple and commonplace, and only after
you've ruled out those should you consider the more radical alternatives.

Always listen to experts.  They'll tell you what can't be done and why.
Then do it.

If it can't be expressed in figures, it is not science; it is opinion.

Most 'scientists' are bottle washers and button sorters.

The truth of a proposition has nothing to do with its credibility.  And
vice versa.

Never underestimate the power of human stupidity.

The difference between science and the fuzzy subjects is that science
requires reasoning, while those other subjects require merely scholarship.

Expertise in one field does not carry over into other fields.  But experts
often think so.  The narrower their field of knowledge the more likely they
are to think so.

Natural laws have no pity.

Climate is what we expect.  Weather is what we get.

                       THEOLOGICAL ENGINEERING EXAM
                         5 Questions, 60 Minutes.

You may use a calculator, the Bible, the Koran, the Torah, and the Book
of Mormon.  The speed of light is c.  Show all work.  For all problems,
assume a perfectly spherical Jesus of constant density D.  No praying
during the exam.

1.  (20 pts.)  Bob and Joe are standing on a street corner.  God loves
each an equal amount L_0.  Bob then accelerates to .9c.  In Joe's rest
frame, how much does God now love Bob?

2.  Sven, a Catholic, is in a state of grace.  He then has sex with
sheep S.  a.  (8 pts.)  What is Sven's atonement coefficient following
the act if the sheep was not willing?  b.  (12 pts.)  What if the
sheep, while not technically being willing, could not be said to mind
either?

3.  (20 pts.)  Let the eternal, all abiding love of the Holy Spirit be
the xy plane.  Let Sue's soul be at (0,0,5) at t = 0 sec., traveling at
5 m/s in the direction of the positive z axis.  Everything is in
Cartesian coordinates bespeaking subscription to a perfectly rational
Enlightenment attitude towards the Universe.  At what time t will Sue
be saved?  (Hint:  Assume a point soul.)

4.  (20 pts.)  Assume the Rapture occurs at time t.  Cornelia, a saved
human weighing 90 kg, in a state of grace, has her head in the closing
jaws of an alligator at time t.  What mass of meat will remain to the
alligator at time t + 10 sec.?

5.  Stan is a frictionless, massless Mormon in a rest state.  His sin
level for his faith is currently 11 McBeals.  He eats .3 kg of pork,
and enjoys it very much.  Assume that the Jews are right about, well,
pretty much everything.  a.  (10 pts.)  What is Stan's sin level now?
b.  (10 pts.)Stan is one of them Salt Lake City Mormons.  He ain't so
damn smug now, is he?

Extra Credit (10 pts):  25 grams of wafers and 20 ml of cheap wine
undergo transubstantiation and become the flesh and blood of our Lord.
How many Joules of heat are released by the transformation?

Hand in exam when done, and may God have mercy on your work.

                         THE TIME AND DATE OF CREATION

The Creation, as everyone knows, took place in 4004 B.C.  To be really
exact it took place at 6 p.m. on Wednesday, March 21st, 4004 B.C. The
evidence for these dates is entirely documentary.  The date of the year as
calculated by Archbishop Ussher is obtained by taking the Jewish date of
the Flood -- 2348 B.C. -- and adding to it in succession the age of each
patriarch when he begat a son. The other items can be worked out from the
data given in the first chapter of Genesis:

* Six p.m. The periods of creation are divided into "days" and each "day"
is said to consist of evening and morning, showing that the "day" began on
what we should now call the evening before, e.g., Passover, Day of
Atonement, Eve of St John, Eve of All Hallows, Ramadan, and in Palestine,
Easter Eve.

* Wednesday.  The earth was created on the fourth day of the week, and
Wednesday is the fourth day of the week.

* March 21.  As the length of days varies according to the season of the
year, it is obvious that any calculation must have been made when day and
night were equally balanced, i.e. one of the equinoxes. And as the vernal
equinox has always been more important than the autumnal, we get March 21.

** Therefore: the full date, 6 p.m., Wednesday, March 21.

SL: Have you noticed that a man has been following us for the past
half-hour?

SM: Yes, I wonder what he wants.

SL: It's logical. He wants to rape us.

SM: Oh, no! At this rate he will reach us in 15 minutes at the most. What
can we do?

SL: The only logical thing to do of course is to walk faster.

SM: It's not working.

SL: Of course it's not working. The man did the only logical thing.  He
started to walk faster too.

SM: So, what shall we do? At this rate he will reach us in one minute.

SL: The only logical thing we can do is split.  You go that way and I'll go
this way. He cannot follows us both.

So the man decided to follow Sister Logical.  Sister Mathematical arrives
at the convent and is worried what has happened to Sister Logical. Then
Sister Logical arrives.

SM: Sister Logical! Thank God you are here! Tell me what happened!

SL: The only logical thing happened. The man couldn't follow us both, so he
followed me.

SM: Yes, yes! But what happened then?

SL: The only logical thing happened. I started to run as fast as I could
and he started to run as fast as he could.

SM: And?

SL: The only logical thing happened. He reached me.

SM: Oh, dear! What did you do?

SL: The only logical thing to do. I lifted my dress up.

                               The Condemned

When the earth was created, the powers above,
Gave each man a job to work at and love.
He made doctors and lawyers and plumbers and then,
He made carpenters, singers, and confidence men.
And when each had a job to work as he should,
He looked them all over and saw it was good.

He then sat down to rest for a day,
When a horrible groan chanced to come his way.
The Lord then looked down and his eyes opened wide,
For a motley collection of bums stood outside.
"And what do you want?" the creator asked them,
"Help us," they cried out, "A job for us men".
"We have no profession," they cried in dismay,
"And even the jails have turned us away".
Said the Lord, "I've seen many things without worth,
But here I find gathered the scum of the earth!"

The Lord was perplexed, and then he was mad,
For the jobs were all gone, there was none to be had.
Then he spoke aloud in a deep angry tone,
"Forever and ever ye mongrels shall roam,
Ye shall freeze in the summer and sweat when it's cold,
Ye shall work on equipment that's dirty and old,
Ye shall crawl under raised floors, and there cables lay,
Ye shall be called out at midnight and work through the day,
Ye shall work on all holidays, and not make your worth,
Ye shall be blamed for all downtime that occurs on the earth,
Ye shall watch all the glory go to software and sales,
Ye shall be blamed by them both if the system then fails.
Ye shall be paid nothing out of sorrow and tears,
Ye shall be forever cursed, and called FIELD ENGINEERS!"

It seems certain that Einstein was doubly wrong when he said "God does not
play dice." Consideration of particle emission from black holes would seem
to suggest that God not only plays dice but also sometimes throws them
where they cannot be seen.  -- Dr Stephen W. Hawking, NATURE, 1975 [no
article by Hawking in Nature that year, but mentioned thus: Specifically,
it is in Nature 257 (October 2, 1975), 352, an account of a conference
written by Malcolm MacCallum.  The account begins "God not only plays dice.
He also sometimes throws the dice where they cannot be seen" This statement
is made by S. W. Hawking (Cambridge University) in his recent work on black
holes...  The reference seems to be to two preprints circulated by Hawking.
[also found in] Hawking concluded by reminding us that Albert Einstein once
said "God does not play dice with the universe."  "On the contrary,"
Hawking said, "it appears that not only does God play dice, but also that
he sometimes throws the dice where they cannot be seen."  --Jerry
Pournelle, _Galaxy_ magazine article reporting on Hawking lecture at Cal
Tech, October 1975, collected in the book _A Step Farther Out_ by Jerry

God does not play dice with the universe; He plays an ineffable game of His
own devising, which might be compared, from the perspective of the players,

 Albert Einstein (1879-1955)

I want to know God's thoughts; the rest are details.

Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new.

Science is a wonderful thing if one does not have to earn one's living at
it.

The secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources.

God does not care about our mathematical difficulties. He integrates
empirically.

One had to cram all this stuff into one's mind for the examinations,
whether one liked it or not.  This coercion had such a deterring effect on
me that, after I had passed the final examination, I found the
consideration of any scientific problems distasteful to me for an entire
year.

...one of the strongest motives that lead men to art and science is escape
from everyday life with its painful crudity and hopeless dreariness, from
the fetters of one's own ever-shifting desires.  A finely tempered nature
longs to escape from the personal life into the world of objective
perception and thought.

therefore part of the mystery that we are trying to solve.

On Reflecting: Ego is the immediate dictate of human consciousness.

On Adopting: Anybody who has been seriously engaged is scientific work of
any kind realizes that over the entrance to the gates of the temple of
science are written the words: 'Ye must have faith.' It is a quality which
the scientist cannot dispense with.

On Nurturing: We have no right to assume that any physical laws exist, or
if they have existed up until now, that they will continue to exist in a
similar manner in the future.

    in the Old O\"olitic Silurian Period, just a million years ago next
    November, the Lower Mississippi River was upward of one million three
    hundred thousand miles long, and stuck out over the Gulf of Mexico like
    a fishing-rod.  And by the same token any person can see that seven
    hundred and forty-two years from now the Lower Mississippi will be only
    a mile and three-quarters long, and Cairo and New Orleans will have
    joined their streets together, and be plodding comfortably along under
    a single mayor and a mutual board of alderman.  There is something
    fascinating about science.  One gets such wholesome returns of
    conjecture out of such a trifling investment of fact.

Basic research is when I'm doing what I don't know I'm doing.

I have learned to use the word "impossible" with the greatest caution.

The best computer is a man, and it's the only one that can be mass-produced

Crash programs fail because they are based on theory that, with nine women

We can lick gravity, but sometimes the paperwork is overwhelming.

One could not be a successful scientist without realizing that, in contrast
to the popular conception supported by newspapers and mothers of
scientists, a goodly number of scientists are not only narrow-minded and
dull, but also just stupid.

The aim of science is to seek the simplest explanation of complex facts. We
are apt to fall into the error of thinking that the facts are simple
because simplicity is the goal of our quest.  The guiding motto in the life
of every natural philosopher should be, "Seek simplicity and distrust it."

				THE LAST WORD
		     The Ultimate Scientific Dictionary



Activation Energy:  	The useful quantity of energy available in one cup
			of coffee.

Atomic Theory:		A mythological explanation of the nature of matter,
			first proposed by the ancient Greeks, and now 
			thoroughly discredited by modern computer simulation.
			Attempts to verify the theory by modern computer 
			simulation have failed.  Instead, it has been 
			demonstrated repeatedly that computer outputs depend
			upon the color of the programmer's eyes, or occasionally
			upon the month of his or her birth.  This apparent 
			astrological connection, at last, vindicates the
			alchemist's view of astrology as the mother of all
			science.

Bacon, Roger:		An English friar who dabbled in science and made
			experimentation fashionable.  Bacon was the first 
			science popularizer to make it big on the banquet and
			talk-show circuit, and his books even outsold the fad
			diets of the period.

Biological Science:	A contradiction in terms.

Bunsen Burner:		A device invented by Robert Bunsen (1811-1899) for 
			brewing coffee in the laboratory, thereby enabling
			the chemist to be poisoned without having to go all
			the way to the company cafeteria.

Butyl:			An unpleasant-sounding word denoting an unpleasant-
			smelling alcohol.

CAI:			Acronym for "Computer-Aided Instruction".  The modern
			system of training professional scientists without
			ever exposing them to the hazards and expense of 
			laboratory work.  Graduates of CAI-based programs are
			very good at simulated research.

Cavendish:		A variety of pipe tobacco that is reputed to produce
			remarkably clear thought processes, and thereby leads
			to major scientific discoveries; hence, the name of a 
			British research laboratory where the tobacco is 
			smoked in abundance.

Chemical:		A substance that:  1)  An organic chemist turns into a
			foul odor;  2)  an analytical chemist turns into a 
			procedure;  3)  a physical chemist turns into a
			straight line;  4)  a biochemist turns into a helix;
			5)  a chemical engineer turns into a profit.

Chemical Engineering:	The practice of doing for a profit what an organic
			chemist only does for fun.

Chromatography:		(From Gr. chromo [color] + graphos [writing])  The 
			practice of submitting manuscripts for publication
			with the original figures drawn in non-reproducing
			blue ink.

Clinical Testing:	The use of humans as guinea pigs.  (See also PHAR-
			MACOLOGY and TOXICOLOGY)

Compound:		To make worse, as in:  1)  A fracture;  2)  the 
			mutual adulteration of two or more elements.

Computer Resources:	The major item of any budget, allowing for the 
			acquisition of any capital equipment that is obsolete
			before the purchase request is released.

Eigen Function:		The use to which an eigen is put.

En:			The universal bidentate ligand used by coordination
			chemists.  For years, efforts were made to use ethylene-
			diamine for this purpose, but chemists were unable
			to squeeze all the letters between the corners of
			the octahedron diagram.  The timely invention of 
 			en in 1947 revolutionized the science.

Evaporation Allowance:	The volume of alcohol that the graduate students
			can drink in a year's time.

Exhaustive Methylation:	A marathon event in which the participants methylate
			until they drop from exhaustion.

First Order Reaction:	The reaction that occurs first, not always the one 
			desired.  For example, the formation of brown gunk in
			an organic prep.

Flame Test:		Trial by fire.

Genetic Engineering:	A recent attempt to formalize what engineers have been
			doing informally all along.

Grignard:		A fictitious class of compounds often found on organic 
			exams and never in real life.

Inorganic Chemistry:	That which is left over after the organic, analytical,
			and physical chemists get through picking over the 
			periodic table.

Mercury:		(From L.  Mercurius, the swift messenger of the gods)
			Element No. 80, so named because of the speed of which
			one of its compounds (calomel, Hg2Cl2) goes through 
			the human digestive tract.  The element is perhaps 
			misnamed, because the gods probably would not be
			pleased by the physiological message so delivered.

Monomer:		One mer.  (Compare POLYMER).

Natural Product:	A substance that earns organic chemists fame and glory
			when they manage to systhesize it with great difficulty,
			while Nature gets no credit for making it with great 
			ease.

Organic Chemistry:	The practice of transmuting vile substances into 
			publications.

Partition Function:	The function of a partition is to protect the lab
			supervisor from shrapnel produced in laboratory 
			explosions.

Pass/Fail:		An attempt by professional educators to replace the
			traditional academic grading system with a binary one
			that can be handled by a large digital computer.

Pharmacology:		The use of rabbits and dogs as guinea pigs.  (See also
			CLINICAL TESTING, TOXICOLOGY).

Physical Chemistry:	The pitiful attempt to apply y=mx+b to everything in
			the universe.

Pilot Plant:		A modest facility used for confirming design errors
			before they are built into a costly, full-scale
			production facility.

Polymer:		Many mers.  (Compare MONOMERS).

Prelims:		(From L. pre [before] + limbo [oblivion])  An 
			obligatory ritual practiced by graduate students 
			just before the granting of a Ph.D. (if the gods are 
			appeased) or an M.S. (if they aren't).

Publish or Perish:	The imposed, involuntary choice between fame and 
			oblivion, neither of which is handled gracefully by
			most faculty members.

Purple Passion:		A deadly libation prepared by mixing equal volumes of 
			grape juice and lab alcohol.

Quantum Mechanics:	A crew kept on the payroll to repair quantums, which
			decay frequently to the ground state.

Rate Equations:		(Verb phrase)  To give a grade or a ranking to a
			formula based on its utility and applicability.  H=E,
			for example, applies to everything everywhere, and
			therefore rates an A.  pV=nRT, on the other hand, is 
			good only for nonexistent gases and thus receives
			only a D+, but this grade can be changed to a B- if
			enough empirical virial coefficients are added.

Research:		(Irregular noun)  That which I do for the benefit of
			humanity, you do for the money, he does to hog all the
			glory.

Sagan:			The international unit of humility.

Scientific Method:	The widely held philosophy that a theory can never be 
			proved, only disproved, and that all attempts to 
			explain anything are therefore futile.

SI:			Acronym for "Systeme Infernelle".

Spectrophotometry:	A long word used mainly to intimidate freshman 
			nonmajors.

Spectroscope:		A disgusting-looking instrument used by medical 
			specialists to probe and examine the spectrum.

Toxicology:		The wholesale slaughter of white rats bred 
			especially for that purpose.  (See also CLINICAL 
			TESTING, PHARMACOLOGY).

X-Ray Diffraction:	An occupational disorder common among physicians, 
			caused by reading X-ray pictures in darkened rooms
			for prolonged periods.  The condition is readily 
			cured by a greater reliance on blood chemistries; the
			lab results are just as inconclusive as the X-rays, but 
			are easier to read.

Ytterbium:		A rare and inconsequential element, named after the
			village of Ytterby, Sweden (not to be confused with
			Iturbi, the late pianist and film personality, who 
			was actually Spanish, not Swedish).  Ytterbium is 
			used mainly to fill block 70 in the periodic table.
			Iturbi was used mainly to play Jane Powell's father.

                              By Natalie Goto

Now that the timid Canadian summer has finally decided to grace us with her
presence, voices of dissent have been heard to echo through the
increasingly empty hospitall halls.  The complaint? "Not enough time spent
in the lab!  Far too much lollygagging!  What is it with the students of
today?  Idle hands..."  Evidently, it's time to clear the air and separate
the studious from the slackers.  For this reason, a convenient diagnostic
test has been supplied to help you objectively ascertain the amount of time
that a student has spent in the lab lately.  (Don't worry, the test won't
take up too much of your students' lab time.)

1.  In the fish section of St. Lawrence market, your first thought is: a)
Why don't I buy fish for a change?  b) I should bolster my eicosanoid
levels with some tasty fish eyes!  c) I smell TEMED.

2.  You associate the logo for CAA with: a) The Canadian Automobile
Association.  b) The sound made by a crow.  c) Glutamine.

3.  You have the kind of skin that: a) Tans easily.  b) Burns when exposed
to the sun the first few times.  c) Makes Casper look healthy.

fantastic career stretched out in front of you as far as your nose can see.

                               SCIENCE QUIZ.
 This is a humor column I wrote for the Fresno Bee for 12/10/95. Feel free
to pass it along. If you like it, drop me a line.


        Well, the Galileo spacecraft has blown up on Jupiter, and frankly
we couldn't be more excited. At first glance it seems to be a waste to send
a spacecraft several hundred million miles to be blown up on a distant
planet, when we've got any number of 14 year old boys who would happily
blow it up here on earth for free. But that's sort of missing the
point. That space craft didn't blow up just for fun (though it probably
*was* fun); it blew up in the service of science.

        But it's the fate of science to be misunderstood. Most people took
science in high school but didn't pay attention, due to a sneaking
suspicion that if they did, they'd end up having to teach science to people
just like them. For better or worse, most people's understanding of science
is limited to what they learn off of the "X-Files" and occassional
"Nightline" appearances by Carl Sagan.

        Wait a minute, you say. You can learn a *lot* from that Sagan
guy. Well, yes, you can. But can you learn *enough*? To test this, I've
created this quick science quiz, just a few questions on some basic
scientific ideas. Grab that pencil, haul your thinking cap out of the
attic, and try your hand at these babies. No fair looking at someone else's
paper.

1. The Galileo Spacecraft was named after Galileo Galilei.
Galileo Galilei was:
 A) The Italian astronomer who discovered Jupiter's moons
 B) A notorious mob boss, who was the basis for Don Corleone in "The Godfather"
 C) The nice green grocer down the street from NASA headquarters
 D) Dean Martin's real name.

2. The First Law of Thermodynamics states:
 A) "If you leave the top off the Thermos, your coffee gets cold." 
 B) "Energy is neither created nor destroyed." 
 C) "Entropy is what happens when you just don't care." 
 D) "Use an electron, go to jail."

3. What do Albert Einstein, Erwin Schrodinger and Werner Heisenberg have in
common? 
 A) They are all Leos
 B) They were the backbone of the 1905 University of Chicago defensive line
 C) They are notable physicists
 D) At one time, each of them played guitar for the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

4. Fossils are:
 A) What you call the Rolling Stones if you are under the age of 25
 B) Technically eligible for AARP benefits
 C) God's inside joke
 D) Mineralized remains of prehistoric life.

5. Which of these accurately describes a "black hole":
 A) Any job requiring the use of the phrase "Today's special is..." 
 B) Your credit card bill
 C) A collapsed star with a gravitational field so strong that light cannot
    escape 
 D) Any of the last three seasons of "Saturday Night Live."

6. Define "Medulla Oblongata":
 A) A lesser-known opera of Guiseppe Verdi
 B) A part of the brain situated near the spinal cord
 C) The forbidden dance of love
 D) What Freddie Mercury sings in "Bohemian Rhapsody."

7. Define "quark":
 A) A sub-atomic particle
 B) What ducks say at a nuclear reactor
 C) Slang for flatulence
 D) What you call that ooky stuff that covers a canned ham.

8. Which four names below are the names of the major Jovian moons?
 A) Ciera, Achieva, Integra, Lumina
 B) Fuschia, Magenta, Sienna, Taupe
 C) Groucho, Harpo, Zeppo, Chico
 D) Io, Callisto, Europa, Ganymede

        The answers: 1:A 2:B 3:C 4:D 5:C 6:B 7:A 8:D.
Miss any of these, and *boy,* are you dumb. Which is why someone
else is having all the fun, blowing up space probes. Think about it.

=9.6 MURPHY'S LAW

___________________________________________________________________________
                         MURPHY'S LAWS

THE PRIME AXIOM: In any field of scientific endeavor, anything that
                     can go wrong, will.

 2.  If the possibility exists of several things going wrong, the one that
      will go wrong is the one that will do the most damage.
 3.  Everything will go wrong at one time.
      3.1 That time is always when you least expect it.
 4.  If nothing can go wrong, something will.
 5.  Nothing is as easy as it looks.
 6.  Everything takes longer than you think.
 7.  Left to themselves, things always go from bad to worse.
 8.  Nature always sides with the hidden flaw.
 9.  Given the most inappropriate time for something to go wrong, that's
      when it will occur.
 10.  Mother Nature is a bitch.
      10.1 The universe is not indifferent to intelligence, it is actively
            hostile to it.
 11.  If everything seems to be going well, you have obviously overlooked
      something.
 12.  If in any problem you find yourself doing an immense amount of work,
      the answer can be obtained by simple inspection.
 13.  Never make anything simple and efficient when a way can be found to
      make it complex and wonderful.
 14.  If it doesn't fit, use a bigger hammer.
 15.  In an instrument or device characterized by a number of plus-or-minus
      errors, the total error will be the sum of all the errors adding in
      the same direction.
 16.  In any given calculation, the fault will never be placed if more than
      one person is involved.
      16.1 In any given discovery, the credit will never be properly placed
            if more than one person is involved.
 17.  All warranty and guarantee clauses become invalid upon payment of the
      final invoice.
 18.  Murphy's Law: "If there are two or more ways to do something, and one
      of those ways can result in a catastrophe, then someone will do it."
___________________________________________________________________________
From: Freek <frbrysse@vub.ac.be>
 "Proof of Murphy's Law: Murphy's Law cannot be proven, yet is correct, as
when you try to prove Murphy's Law, you will see that the proof is
incorrect. This is obviously due to Murphy's Law, therefore Murphy's Law is
correct and proven."

     If, of the seven hours you spend at work, six hours and fifty-five
     minutes are spent working at your desk, and the rest of the time
     you throw the bull with your cubicle-mate, the time at which
     your supervisor will walk in and ask what you're doing can be
     determined to within five minutes.

___________________________________________________________________________
From: goble@infonaut.com (Clark Goble) 
As soon as you make something

idiot-proof, along comes another idiot.
            -- Grave's Law
E__________________________________________________________________________
                     LAWS RELATING TO DESIGN:
 1.  In any given price estimate, the cost of the equipment will exceed
      estimated expenditure by a factor of 3.
 2.  Dimensions will always be expressed in the least useable terms.  For
      example, velocity will be expressed in furlongs/fortnight.
 3.  If the breadbox trial model functions perfectly, the finished product
      will not percolate.
 4.  In a mathematical calculation, any error that can creep in, will.  It
      will be in the direction that will do the most damage to
      the calculation.
 5.  In any collection of data, the figures that are obviously correct,
      beyond all need of checking, contain the errors.
 6.  The probability of a dimension or value being omitted from a drawing
      is directly proportional to its importance.
 7.  In specifications, Murphy's Law supersedes Ohm's.
 8.  Information necessitating a change in design will be conveyed to the
      designer after, and only after, the plans are complete.
 9.  In simple cases, presenting one obvious right way vs.  one obvious
      wrong way, it is often wiser to choose the wrong way so as to
      expedite subsequent revisions.
 10.  The more innocuous a modification appears to be, the further its
      influence will extend and the more plans will have to be redrawn.
E__________________________________________________________________________
                     LAWS RELATING TO ASSEMBLY:

 1.  If a project requires n components, there will be n-1 components
      available.
 2.  Interchangeable parts won't.
 3.  Components that must not and cannot be assembled improperly will be.
 4.  The most delicate component will be dropped.
 5.  The construction and operation manual will be discarded with the
      packing material.  The garbage truck will have picked it up
      five minutes before the mad dash to the rubbish can.

 9.  Tolerances will accumulate unidirectionally toward maximum difficulty
      of assembly.
 10.  The availability of a component is inversely proportional to the need
      for that component.
 11.  If a particular resistance is needed, that value will not be
available.
      Furthermore, it cannot be developed with any series or parallel
      combination.

                  Murphy's Ten Laws for String Theorists:

(1) If you fix a mistake in a mathematical superstring calculation, another
one will show up somewhere else.

(2) If your results are based on the work of others, then one such work will
turn out to be wrong. (3) The longer your article, the more likely your
computer hard disk drive will fail while you are typing the references.

(4) The better your research result, the more likely it will be rejected by
the referee of a journal; on the other hand, if your work is wrong but not
obviously so, it will be accepted for publication right away.

(5) If a result seems to good to be true, it is unless you are one of the
top ten string theorists in the world. (By the way, these theorists refer to
their results as "string miracles".)

(6) Your most startling string-theoretic theorem will turn out to be valid
in only two spatial dimensions or less.

(7) When giving a string seminar, nobody will follow anything you say after
the first minute, but, if miraculously someone does, then that person will
point out a flaw in your reasoning half-way through your talk and what will
be worse is that your grant review officer will happen to be in the
audience.

(8) For years, nobody will ever notice the fudge factors in your
calculations, but when you come up for tenure they will surface like fish
being tossed fresh breadcrumbs.

(9) If you are a graduate student working on string theory, then the field
will be dead by the time you get your Ph.D.; Even worse, if you start over
with a new thesis topic, the new field will also be dead by the time you get
your Ph.D.

(10) If you discover an interesting string model, then it will predict at
least one low-energy, observable particle not seen in Nature.

In summary, anything in string theory that theoretically can go wrong will
go wrong, but if nothing does go theoretically wrong, then experimentally it
is ruled out.

See explanation String Theory Jokes:
Physics 10: String theory is a unification model based on the idea that all
elementary particles are different vibrations of a microscopic string.
Concerning (6), string theories are formulated in various numbers of spatial
dimensions, of which nine is the most popular. Concerning (10), the phase
"low-energy, observable particle" means that current accelerators are
capable of producing and detecting it.

=9.7 PROOF METHODS

_________________________________________________________________________

                               PROOF METHODS

WIPE-METHOD: One wipes the blackboard, immediately after writing. (write
to the right, wipe to the left.)
METHOD OF EXACT DESCRIPTION: Let p be a point q, that we will call r.
PREHISTORIC METHOD: Somebody has once proven this.
AUTHORITY BELIEVE METHOD: That must be right. It stands in Forster.
AUTHORITY CRITICAL METHOD: That must be wrong. It stands in Jaenich.
COGNITION PHILOSOPHY, METHOD 1: I recognized the problem!
COGNITION PHILOSOPHY, METHOD 2: I believe, I recognized the probelm!
PACIFISTIC METHOD: Thus, before we fight about it, let's just believe it
COMMUNICATIVE METHOD: Does anybody of you know it?
KAPITALISTIC METHOD: The profit is maximal, if we do not proof anything,
because that costs the leasts pieces of chalk.
COMMUNISTIC METHOD: We proof it together. Everybody writes a line and the
result is government property.
NUMERICAL METHOD: Roughly rounded, it is correct.
SMART GUYS METHOD: We do not proof that now. Anyway, it is to complicated
for the physicists.
TIMELESS METHOD: We proof so long till nobody knows wether the proof is
ended or not.
___________________________________________________________________________
                         PROOF TECHNIQUES

written by Armen H. Zemanian, published in The Physics Teacher, May 1994.

The usual techniques for proving things are often inadequate because they
are merely concerned with truth. For more practical objectives, there are
other powerful - but generally unacknowledged - methods. Here is an
(undoubtedly incomplete) list of them:

Proof of Blatant Assertion: Use words and phrases like
"clearly...,""obviously...,""it is easily shown that...," and "as any fool
can plainly see..."

Proof by Seduction: "If you will just agree to believe this, you might get
a better final grade."

Proof by Intimidation: "You better believe this if you want to pass the
course."

Proof by Interruption: Keep interrupting until your opponent gives up.

Proof by Misconception: An example of this is the Freshman's Conception of
the Limit Process: "2 equals 3 for large values of 2." Once introduced, any
conclusion is reachable.

Proof by Obfuscation: A long list of lemmas is helpful in this case - the
more, the better.

Proof by Confusion: This is a more refined form of proof by
obfuscation. The long list of lemmas should be arranged into circular
patterns of reasoning - and perhaps more baroque structures such as
figure-eights and fleurs-de-lis.

Proof by Exhaustion: This is a modification of an inductive proof. Instead
of going to the general case after proving the first one, prove the second
case, then the third, then the fourth, and so on - until a sufficiently
large n is achieved whereby the nth case is being propounded to a soundly
sleeping audience.

More proof methods: Proof by passion: The author gives the proof with a lot
of passion,
  expressive eyes and vigorous movements...

Proof by example: The author gives only the case n = 2 and suggests that
  it contains most of the ideas of the general proof.

Proof by intimidation: 'Trivial.'

Proof by vigorous handwaving: Works well in a classroom or seminar
  setting.

Proof by cumbersome notation: Best done with access to at least four
  alphabets and special symbols.

Proof by exhaustion: An issue or two of a journal devoted to your proof
  is useful.

Proof by omission: 'The reader may easily supply the details.'  'The other
253 cases are analogous.'  '...'

Proof by obfuscation: A long plotless sequence of true and/or
  meaningless syntactically related statements.

Proof by wishful citation:
  The author cites the negation, converse, or generalization of a
  theorem from literature to support his claims.

Proof by funding: How could three different government agencies be
  wrong?

Proof by personal communication: 'Eight-dimensional colored cycle
  stripping is NP-complete [Karp, personal communication].'

Proof by reduction to the wrong problem: 'To see that infinite-
  dimensional colored cycle stripping is decidable, we reduce it to
  the halting problem.'

Proof by reference to inaccessible literature: The author cites a simple
  corollary of a theorem to be found in a privately circulated memoir
  of the Slovenian Philological Society, 1883.

Proof by importance: A large body of useful consequences all follow from
  the proposition in question.

Proof by accumulated evidence: Long and diligent search has not revealed
  a counterexample.

Proof by cosmology: The negation of the proposition is unimaginable or
  meaningless. Popular for proofs of the existence of God.

Proof by mutual reference: In reference A, Theorem 5 is said to follow
  from Theorem 3 in reference B, which is shown from Corollary 6.2 in
  reference C, which is an easy consequence of Theorem 5 in reference
  A.

Proof by metaproof: A method is given to construct the desired proof.
  The correctness of the method is proved by any of these techniques.

Proof by picture: A more convincing form of proof by example. Combines
  well with proof by omission.

Proof by vehement assertion: It is useful to have some kind of authority
  in relation to the audience.

Proof by ghost reference: Nothing even remotely resembling the cited
  theorem appears in the reference given.

Proof by forward reference: Reference is usually to a forthcoming paper
  of the author, which is often not as forthcoming as at first.

Proof by semantic shift: Some standard but inconvenient definitions are
  changed for the statement of the result.

Proof by appeal to intuition: Cloud-shaped drawings frequently help
  here.

Even more Proof Techniques

Methods for getting people to believe you (as good as, if not better than,
proof).  A collection of proof techniques that will prove invaluable to
both mathematicians and members of the general public.

PROOF TECHNIQUE #1 - 'Proof By Induction'

     1.  Obtain a large power transformer.
     2.  Find someone who does not believe your theorem.
     3.  Get this person to hold the terminals on the HV side of the
         transformer.
     4.  Apply 25000 volts AC to the LV side of the transformer.
     5.  Repeat step (4) until they agree with the theorem.

PROOF TECHNIQUE #2 - 'Proof By Contradiction'

     1.  State your theorem.
     2.  Wait for someone to disagree.
     3.  Contradict them.

PROOF TECHNIQUE #3 - Fire Proof

     1.  Summon all your inferiors for a departmental meeting.
     2.  Present your theorem.
     3.  Fire those who disagree.

PROOF TECHNIQUE #4 - The Famous Water Proof

     1.  State your theorem.
     2.  Wait for someone to disagree.
     3.  Drown them.

     NB.  This is closely related to the 'bullet' proof, but is easier
     to make look like an accident.

PROOF TECHNIQUE #5 - Idiot Proof

     1.  State your theorem.
     2.  Write exhaustive documentation with glossy colour pictures
         and arrows about which bit goes where.
     3.  Challenge anyone to not understand it.

PROOF TECHNIQUE #6 - Child Proof

     1.  State your theorem.
     2.  Encapsulate it in epoxy and shape it into an ellipsoid.
     3.  Put it in a jar with all the other proofs (one with one of
         those Press-to-Open lids).
     4.  Give it to a professor and challenge him to open it.

PROOF TECHNIQUE #7 - Rabbit Proof

     1.  Generate theorems at an altogether startling rate, much
         faster than anybody is able to refute them. Use up every
         body else's paper.  Run away at the slightest sign of danger.
     2.  Leave any crap in small, easily identified piles, in
         prominent places where you no longer are, and it cannot in
         fact be proven that you ever were.

PROOF TECHNIQUE #8 - Fool Proof

     1.  State your theorem.
     2.  Invite colleagues to comment.
     3.  If they don't agree, exclaim loudly, "You Fools!"

A query from Laurie Snell at Dartmouth...

----- Forwarded message from J. Laurie Snell -----

I wonder if you could do me a favor.  I am trying to find the origin of the
mathematician-baker story.  The version I heard was that Poincare bought
bread once a day from his local baker.  The bread was supposed to weigh 1
kilo but afer a year of record keeping Poicare found a nice normal
distribution with mean 950 gr. He called the police and they told the baker
to behave himself.  One year later Poicare reported to the police that the
baker had not reformed.  The police confronted the baker and he said "How
could Poicare have known that we always gave him the largest loaf?
Poincare then showed the police his record for this year which was again a
bell shaped curve with max at 950 gr.  but trucated on the left side.

There is an exhibit at the Boston Science Museum about this but there is no
reference given.

Could you ask your newsgroups if anyone knows the orgin of this story?
Thanks.  Laurie

Too bad Kelvin largely remembered as a fount of regrettable quotations
these days--he *did* do a lot of heavy lifting to get us from then to now.

	I came into the room, which was half dark, and presently spotted
Lord Kelvin in the audience and realized that I was in for trouble at the
last part of my speech dealing with the age of the earth, where my views
conflicted with his.  To my relief, Kelvin fell fast asleep, but as I came
to the important point, I saw the old bird sit up, open an eye and cock a
balefule glance at me!  Then a sudden inspiration came, and I said Lord
Kelvin had limited the age of the earth, *provided no new source (of
energy) was discovered.* That prophetic utterance refers to what we are now
considering tonight, radium!  Behold! the old boy beamed upon me.

 Paul Erdos, currently most prolific mathematician in history, is always
making jokes about how old he is. (He says, for example, that he is two and
a half billion years old, because in his youth the age of the Earth was
known to be two billion years and now it is known to be 4.5 billion years.)

He observed one day that the audiences at his talks had been getting larger
and larger, to the point where they filled halls so big that his old and
feeble voice could not be heard. Erdos speculated as to the cause of this.

"I think," he said, "it must be that everyone wants to be able to say 'I
remember Erdos; why, I even attended his last lecture!'"

"There was a storm with thunder and lightening.  Little Paul Erdos was in

mothers seem to instinctively do, she found the right words.  "It's all

between n and 2n".

After that, little Paul drifted off into a blissful sleep."

times nine," he began, "Seven times nine is er -- ah --- ah -- seven times
nine is. . . ."  "Sixty-one," a student suggested. Kummer wrote 61 on the
board.  "Sir," said another student, "it should be sixty-nine."  "Come,
come, gentlemen, it can't be both," Kummer exclaimed. "It must be one or
the other."

Paul Erdös had another version of this story, how
Kummer calculated 7 x 9: Kummer said to himself: "Hmmm the product cannot
be 61, because 61 is prime, it cannot be 65, because 65 is a multiple of 5,
67 is a prime, 69 is too big - Only 63 is left."

 This story is about the number 2^67-1, the 67th Mersenne number (Numbers,
Mersenne had claimed to be prime, which was proven to be non-prime in 1903
by F.N.Cole (1861-1927). In the October meeting of the AMS, Cole announced
a talk "On the Factorisation of Large Numbers".
  He walked up to the blackboard without saying a word, calculated by hand
the value of 2^67, carefully subtracted 1. Then he multiplied two numbers
(which were 193707721 and 761838257287). Both results written on the
blackboard were equal. Cole silently walked back to his seat, and this is
said to be the first and only talk held during an AMS meeting where the
audience applauded. There were no questions.  It took Cole about 3 years,
each sunday, to find this factorisation, according to what he said.

of Science", published in London, 1952; you can find the story in David
Wells: "The Penguin Dictionary of Curious and Interesting Numbers" (Penguin

For the curious: 2^67 -1 = 193707721 x 761838257287 = 147573952589676412927

 (I'm not sure if the following one is a true story or not)
    The great logician Bertrand Russell (or was it A.N. Whitehead?)  once
claimed that he could prove anything if given that 1+1=1.
    So one day, some smarty-pants asked him, "Ok.  Prove that you're the
Pope."
    He thought for a while and proclaimed, "I am one.  The Pope is one.
Therefore, the Pope and I are one."

[NOTE: The following is from merritt@Gendev.slc.paramax.com (Merritt).  The
story about 1+1=1 causing ridiculous consequences was, I believe,
originally the product of a conversation at the Trinity High Table.  It is
recorded in Sir Harold Jeffreys' Scientific Inference, in a note to chapter
one.  Jeffreys remarks that the fact that everything followed from a single
contradiction had been noticed by Aristotle (I doubt this way of putting it
is quite correct, but that is beside the point).  He goes on to say that
McTaggart denied the consequence: "if 2+2=5, how can you prove that I am
the pope?"  Hardy is supposed to have replied: "if 2+2=5, 4=5; subtract 3;
then 1=2; but McTaggart and the pope are two; therefore McTaggart and the
pope are one."  When I consider this story, I am astonished at how much
more brilliant some people are than I (quite independent of the fallacies
in the argument).

Since McTaggart, Hardy, Whitehead, and Russell (the last two of whom were
credited with a variant of Hardy's argument in your post) were all fellows
of Trinity and Jeffreys (their exact contemporary) was a fellow of
St. Johns, I suspect that (whatever the truth of Jeffreys' story) it is
very unlikely that Whitehead or Russell had anything to do with it.  The
extraordinary point to me about the story is that Hardy was able to snap
this argument out between mouthfuls, so to speak, and he was not even a
logician at all.  This is probably why it came in some people's minds to be
attributed to one or other of the famous Trinity logicians.

From: Karl Beidatsch <jvdhoek@cygnus.uwa.edu.au>

No, no. The reason it was attributed to one of them is easily provable if
given that 1+1=1.

McTaggart is one; Hardy is one. Therefore Mctaggart and Hardy are
one. We'll call this MH.  Whitehead is one; Russell is one. Therefore
Whitehead and Russell are one. We'll call this WR.  MH is one; WR is
one. Therefore MH and WR are one. We'll call this MW.  Jeffreys is one; MW
is one. Therefor Jeffreys and MW are one.

Ergo, all five are actually one person; the unit MHWRJ is their collective
consciousness.

Just goes to show what a little idiocy can do for you.

The mathematician Hardy was to give a keynote speech at a conference.
Asked for an advance summary, he said he would present a proof of the
Rieman zeta hypothesis -- but they should keep it under their hats. When he
arrived, though, he spoke on a much more prosaic topic. Afterwards the
conference organizers asked why he said he'd talk about the theorem and
then didn't.  He replied this was his standard practice, just in case he
was killed on the way to the conference.

It was part of his tactics against God - in that he thought God would not
allow him to die on the sea trip, because then everyone would think that
Hardy had solved this great theorem.  Hardy had other anti-God tactics,
including always taking an umbrella, and some grading or other boring work,
with him to the cricket games.  For an athiest Hardy certainly spent a lot
of effort against God.

Apparently Hardy's ambitions were:

1.  Prove the Riemann zeta hypthosesis.  
2.  Score the winning play in an important game of cricket.
3.  Murder Mussolini
4.  Prove the non-existance of God.

Well, I think that these ambitions (and maybe a couple of others) were
listed in Nature many years ago - maybe someone else on the usernet would
know.

John von Neumann (1903-1957) [Hungarian/US mathematician and scientist] The
following problem can be solved either the easy way or the hard way.

Two trains 200 miles apart are moving toward each other; each one is going
at a speed of 50 miles per hour.  A fly starting on the front of one of
them flies back and forth between them at a rate of 75 miles per hour.  It
does this until the trains collide and crush the fly to death.  What is the
total distance the fly has flown?

The fly actually hits each train an infinite number of times before it gets
crushed, and one could solve the problem the hard way with pencil and paper
by summing an infinite series of distances.  The easy way is as follows:
Since the trains are 200 miles apart and each train is going 50 miles an
hour, it takes 2 hours for the trains to collide.  Therefore the fly was
flying for two hours.  Since the fly was flying at a rate of 75 miles per
hour, the fly must have flown 150 miles.  That's all there is to it.

When this problem was posed to John von Neumann, he immediately replied,
"150 miles."

"It is very strange," said the poser, "but nearly everyone tries to sum the
infinite series."

"What do you mean, strange?" asked Von Neumann.  "That's how I did it!"

famous John von Neumann in the hallway:

Student: "Er, excuse me, Professor von Neumann, could you please
           help me with a calculus problem?" 
John: "Okay, sonny, if it's real quick -- I'm a busy man."  
Student: "I'm having trouble with this integral."
John: "Let's have a look."  
      (insert brief pause here)
      "Alright, sonny, the answer's two-pi over 5."
Student: "I know that, sir, the answer's in the back -- I'm
           having trouble deriving it, though."
John: "Okay, let me see it again."
      (another pause)
      "The answer's two-pi over 5."
Student (frustrated): "Uh, sir, I _know_ the answer, I just don't see how
       to derive it."
John: "Whaddya want, sonny, I worked the problem in two different ways!"

Von Neumann and Norbert Wiener were both the subject of many dotty
professor stories.  Von Neumann supposedly had the habit of simply writing
answers to homework assignments on the board (the method of solution being,
of course, obvious) when he was asked how to solve problems.  One time one
of his students tried to get more helpful information by asking if there
was another way to solve the problem.  Von Neumann looked blank for a
moment, thought, and then answered, "Yes".

Wiener was in fact very absent minded.  The following story is told about
him: When they moved from Cambridge to Newton his wife, knowing that he
would be absolutely useless on the move, packed him off to MIT while she
directed the move.  Since she was certain that he would forget that they
had moved and where they had moved to, she wrote down the new address on a
piece of paper, and gave it to him.  Naturally, in the course of the day,
an insight occurred to him. He reached in his pocket, found a piece of
paper on which he furiously scribbled some notes, thought it over, decided
there was a fallacy in his idea, and threw the piece of paper away.  At the
end of the day he went home (to the old address in Cambridge, of course).
When he got there he realized that they had moved, that he had no idea
where they had moved to, and that the piece of paper with the address was
long gone.  Fortunately inspiration struck.  There was a young girl on the
street and he conceived the idea of asking her where he had moved to,
saying, "Excuse me, perhaps you know me.  I'm Norbert Wiener and we've just
moved.  Would you know where we've moved to?"  To which the young girl
replied, "Yes daddy, mommy thought you would forget."

The capper to the story is that I asked his daughter (the girl in the
story) about the truth of the story, many years later.  She said that it
wasn't quite true -- that he never forgot who his children were!  The rest
of it, however, was pretty close to what actually happened...

Academy in Paris. In the carriage he got a brilliant idea which he
immediately wrote down ... on the wand of the carriage: dH=ipdl/r^2. As he
arrived he payed the driver and ran into the building to tell everyone.
Then he found out his notes were on the carriage and he had to hunt through
the streets of Paris to find his notes on wheels.

During a class of calculus my lecturer suddenly checked himself and stared
intently at the table in front of him for a while. Then he looked up at us
and explained that he thought he had brought six piles of papers with him,
but "no matter how he counted" there was only five on the table.  Then he
became silent for a while again and then told the following story:

"When I was young in Poland I met the great mathematician Waclaw
Sierpinski.  He was old already then and rather absent-minded.  Once he had
to move to a new place for some reason.  His wife didn't trust him very
much, so when they stood down on the street with all their things, she
said:
 - Now, you stand here and watch our ten trunks, while I go and get a
   taxi.

She left and left him there, eyes somewhat glazed and humming absently.
Some minutes later she returned, presumably having called for a taxi.  Says
Mr. Sierpinski (possibly with a glint in his eye):
 - I thought you said there were ten trunks, but I've only counted to nine.
 - No, they're TEN!
 - No, count them: 0, 1, 2, ..."

The encylopedist Diderot paid a visit to the Russian Court at the
invitation of the empress.  He conversed very freely, and gave the younger
members of the court circle a good deal of lively atheism.  The empress was
much amused, but some of her councillors suggested that it might be
desirable to check these expositions of doctrine.  the empress did not like
to put a direct muzzle on her guest's tongue, so the following plot was
contrived.  Diderot was informed that a learned mathematician was in
possession of an algebraical demonstration of the existence of God, and
would give it him before all the Court, if he desired to hear it.  Diderot
gladly consented.  The mathematician, which was Euler advanced towards
Diderot and said gravely, and in a tone of perfect conviction: "Monsieur,
(a + b^n)/n =x, therefore God exists. Any answer to that!"  Diderot, to
whom algebra was Hebrew, was embarassed and disconcerted; while peals of
laughter rose on all sides.  He asked permission to return to France at
once, which was granted.

 Isaac Newton (English physicist and mathematician (1642-1727):

I am trying to find a reference to a story said to be about Sir Issac
Newton and an orrery, which news:sci.astro readers may be able to help me
with. The story as I have heard it is as follows:

The story is told of an atheist scientist, a friend of Sir Isaac Newton,
who knocked on the door and came in after he had just finished making his
solar system machine (ie one of the machines like the one in the science
museum where you crank the handle and the planets and moons move round).
The man saw the machine and said `how wonderful' and went over to it and
started cranking the handle and the planets went round. As he was doing
this he asked ` who made this?'. Sir Isaac stopped writing and said `nobody
did'.  Then he carried on writing. The man said `You didn't hear me. Who
made the machine?' . Newton replied `I told you. Nobody did.' He stopped
cranking and turned to Isaac `Now listen Isaac, this marvellous machine
must have been made by somebody - don't keep saying that nobody made it.'
At which point Isaac Newton stopped writing and got up. He looked at him
and said `Now isn't it amazing. I tell you that nobody made a simple toy
like that and you don't believe me. Yet you gaze out into the solar system
- the intricate marvelous machine that is around you - and you dare say to
me that noone made that. I don't believe it'. As far as the record goes the
atheist went away and he was no longer an atheist.  He was suddenly
converted to the idea that God was behind the laws that were found in
creation.

Where is the story to be found?  Who was the man?  Also, is it likely to be
incorrect? Since the first orrery machine was 1721, Sir Isaac (1643 - 1727)
must have been quite old at the time.

I welcome email as well as netnews replies - if anyone has a source
reference for this or any other info please let me know.  I have heard that
this story has been seen around on the net .. any leads?

After a remark from the net Peter gave the following in support of the
story: Newton was an Arian, ie he had problems with believing the orthodox
concept of the Trinity, but this doesn't take away from the central point
of the story.  I grant you the story may be apocraphal, (which is why I
originally posted out a request for information which may verify or
discredit it), but I don't think that you can dismiss it because of his
beliefs; what I mean is Newton was a deist not an atheist and as such can
fit the role the story ascribes to him.

"Newton's science was closely related to his theology. In the General
Scholium of his Principia, he states that its purpose was to establish the
existence of God (Westfall, 205,290; Clark, 12; Brooke, p.169; Mandelbrote,
p.292,300). It was to combat atheism (Mandelbrote, p.292), challenge the
mechanical explanation, and point to the need for a wise and benevolent
deity and an intelligent Creator (Harrison, p.27). He believed that the
universe was governed by general, natural laws set up by God, but preserved
by special providence, i.e., aided by supernatural acts, such as comets
(Harrison, p.27; Mandelbrote, p.290). " sourced from Bob Clausen's web
page.

      The English mathematician John Wallis (1616-1703) was

   once bragged to Wallis about his little dog Diamond.

      "My dog Diamond knows some mathematics. Today he
   proved two theorems before lunch."

      "Your dog must be a genius," said Wallis.

      "Oh I wouldn't go that far," replied Newton. "The
   first theorem had an error and the second had a
   pathological exception."

 Niels Bohr (1885-1962) Danish physicist.  Professor Niels Bohr, a famous

Professor Bohr replied, "I understand that it brings you luck if you
believe in it or not."

fact (as experienced listeners already knew) to drop the inside on the

 Here is one more story about Landau:

In the Physical Technical Institute in Kharkov where Landau was working
some time, there was one vain and mediocre but prolific physicist who made
his research mostly by the method of plagiarism. One day he received a
telegram which said that he is nominated for Nobel prize and therefore he
should prepare a corpus of all his papers in the typewritten form in two
copies (btw, it was before the computers) and submit them to the head of
Department of Theoretical Physics (which Landau was) with deadline of 1st
April. The poor man lost his head and did not pay attention to the dubious
date. He began to feel very important and stopped to say "good-day" to his
old friends. He accomplished the great task of typewriting the corpus in
time and laid it on the Landau's table only to be met by the question: "Did
you really believe that Nobel prize could be given for this trash?"

Around the time when Cold War started, Bertrand Russell was giving a
lecture on politics in England.  Being a leftist in a conservative women's
club, he was not received well at all: the ladies came up to him and
started attacking him with whatever they could get their hands on.  The
guard, being an English gentleman, did not want to be rough to the ladies
and yet needed to save Russell from them.  He said, "But he is a great
mathematician!"  The ladies ignored him.  The guard said again, "But he is
a great philosopher!"  The ladies ignore him again.  In desperation,
finally, he said, "But his brother is an earl!"  Bert was saved.

This story is told with several different protagonists. (Who knows the
truth?):

1) Another "true" story, kinda like the aforementioned urban legend: Enrico
Fermi, while studying in college, was bored by his math classes.  He walked
up to the professor and said, "My classes are too easy!"  The professor
looked at him, and said, "Well, I'm sure you'll find this interesting."
Then the professor copied 9 problems from a book to a paper and gave the
paper to Fermi.  A month later, the professor ran into Fermi, "So how are
you doing with the problems I gave you?"  "Oh, they are very hard.  I only
managed to solve 6 of them."  The professor was visibly shocked, "What!?
But those are unsolved problems!"

From: lrmead@whale.st.usm.edu (Lawrence R. Mead)
2) Very nearly this exact story was told to me (or I read it) about the
mathematician David Hilbert when *he* was a grad student. Can anyone here
confirm this?

From: columbus@osf.org (Michael Weiss)
 3) Well now, I heard the same thing about John Milnor.  Moreover the
unsolved problem was showing that any smooth closed curve in 3-space of
total curvature <= 4pi is unknotted, and Milnor *did* prove that as an
undergraduate.

From: visser@ph.tn.tudelft.nl (Boudewijn W. Ch. Visser)
4) It was not Fermi,but George Danzig.

The story as told in news:alt.folklore.urban (see the FAQ from there) tells
about a student,not paying attention.  At the end of the lecture,the
professor writes down 8 problems,and the student,waking up, thinks it is
homework.  At the next class,the student apologizes for having finished
only 4 problems ,and having an idea about 2 more.  Turns out the problems
were famous unsolved problems.  The student was George Danzig.

 While Boltzman gave a lecture on ideal gasses, he casually mentioned
complicated calculations, which didn't give him any trouble. His students
could not follow the fast mathematics and asked him to do the calculations
on the blackboard. Boltzman apologized and promised to do better next time.
 The next lesson he began: "Gentlemen, if we combine Boyle's law with
Charles's law we get the equation pv= p\sub 0 v\sub 0 (1 + a t). Now it is
clear that \sub a S \sup b = f(x) dx x (a), then is pv=RT and \sub V S
f(x,y,z) dV = 0. It is so simple as one and one is two. At this moment he
remembered his promise and dutyfully wrote 1 + 1 = 2. Then he continued
with the complicated calculations from his bare mind.

 Out of the Autobiography of Charles Darwin: One day, on tearing of some
old bark, I saw two rare beetles and seized one in each hand; then I saw a
third and new kind, which I could not bear to lose, so that I popped the
one which I held in my right hand into my mouth.

How about Charles Darwin when he saw a beetle and picked it up. He saw a
second and picked that one up in the other hand. He then saw a third one
which he really wanted. Not knowing what to do, he shoved one of the ones
he was holding into his mouth in order to pick up the third one. The one in
the mouth emmitted some kind of stuff which made him spit out the beetle
and also lose the other two!  Charles R. Darwin (1809-1182) [English
biologist]

There's the story of Sir Eddington, later to become known as Sir
"Adding-one", at an interview with a reporter, in the 30s, I think. The
interviewer said, "I've heard that you're one of the three people in the
world who understand General Relativity." Eddington got a puzzled look on
his face. The interviewer asked him what was the matter, and he replied,
"I'm trying to think who the third person would be."

 Okay, here are a couple of Eddington jokes. You already have a version of
the first one, but this one seems better documented. It is reported by
Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar in _Truth_and_Beauty:_Aesthetics_and_
Motivations_in_Science_, U. Chicago Press, 1987, p. 117, and was told by
Eddington himself to Chandrasekhar and others at a dinner in Trinity during
the Christmas recess of 1933:

  [ ... ] as the joint meeting of the Royal Society and the Royal
  Astronomical Society was dispersing [this was 6 November 1919,
  when the results of the eclipse expedition that confirmed Einstein's
  prediction of the bending of light by gravity were announced],
  Ludwig Silberstein came up to him and said, "Professor Eddington,
  you must be one of three persons in the world who understands
  general relativity." On Eddington's demurring to this statement,
  Silberstein responded, "Don't be modest, Eddington," and Eddington
  replied that, "On the contrary, I am trying to think who the third
  person is."

 The other I read or heard, but I don't remember where. Eddington was
giving a lecture on cosmology and began with a rapid overview of early
models of the universe. He mentioned the Indian idea that the world rested
on the back of a giant turtle, and said it wasn't a good model because it
didn't say what the turtle rested on. After the lecture an elderly lady
went up to him and said, forcefully, "You are very clever, young man, very
clever, but there is something you do not understand about Indian
cosmology: it's turtles ALL THE WAY DOWN!"

A well-known scientist (some say it was Bertrand Russell) once gave a
public lecture on astronomy. He described how the earth orbits around the
sun and how the sun, in turn, orbits around the center of a vast collection
of stars called our galaxy. At the end of the lecture, a little old lady at
the back of the room got up and said: "What you have told us is
rubbish. The world is really a flat plate supported on the back of a giant
tortoise." The scientist gave a superior smile before replying, "What is
the tortoise standing on?"

"You're very clever, young man, very clever," said the old lady. "But it's

AE that he could probably give the lecture himself, haveing heard it
several times. So at the next stop on the tour, AE & the driver switched
places, with AE sitting at the back, in driver's uniform. The driver gave
the lecture, flawlessly. At the end, a member of the audience asked a
detailed question about some of the subject matter, upon which the lecturer
replied, 'well, the answer to that question is quite simple, I bet that my
driver, sitting up at the back, there, could answer it...'.

  Shortly after his seventh birthday Gauss entered his first school, a
squalid relic of the Middle Ages run by a virile brute, one Buettner, whose
idea of teaching the hundred or so boys in his charge wast to trash them
into such a state of terrified stupidity that they forgot their own names.
.....
  In his tenth year Gauss was admitted to the class in arithmetic. As it
was the beginning class none of the boys had ever heard of an arithmetical
progression. It was easy then for the heroic Buettner to give out a long
problem in addition whose answer he could find by a formula in a few
seconds. The problem was of the following sort, 81297 + 81495 + 81693 + ...
+ 100899, where the step from one number to the next is the same all along
(here 198), and a given number of terms (here 100) are to be added.
   It was the custom of the school for the boy who first got the answer to
lay his slate on the table; the next laid his slate on top of the first,
and so on. Buettner had barely finished stating the problem when Gauss
flung his slate on the table: "There it lies", he said. Then, for the
ensuing hour, while the other boys toiled, he sat with his hands folded,
favored now and then by a sarcastic glance from Buettner, who imagined the
youngest pupil in the class was just another blockhead. At the end of the
period Buettner looked over the slates. On Gauss' slate there appeared but
a single number. To the end of his days Gauss loved to tell how the one
number he had written was the correct answer and how all the others were
wrong. Gauss had not been shown the trick for doing such problems rapidly.
It is very ordinary once it is known, but for a boy of ten to find it
instantaneously by himself is not so ordinary.
  This opened the door through wich Gauss passed on to immortality.
Buettner was so astonished at what the boy had done without instruction
that he promptly redeemed himself and to at least one of his pupils became
a humane teacher. .....

Another story about Gauss involves his construction of a septendecagon.  He
went to a professor (whose name escapes me) and said "I have just
constructed a septendecagon!"

"Nonsense.  That is impossible."

"Well, then, I have just figured out how to resolve a seventeenth degree
polynomial."

"Bah.  Trivial; I've done it myself."

Gauss later paid back this professor (who was an amateur poet) by calling
him "The finest poet among mathematicians, and the finest mathematician
among poets."

During a lecture, professor Dirac made a mistake in an equation he was
writing on the blackboard. A couragous student raises his finger and says
timidly : "Professor Dirac, I do not understand equation 2.".Dirac

heard him and raises his finger again, and says, louder this time:
"Professor Dirac, I do not understand equation 2." No reaction. Somebody on

Murray Gell-Mann

In 1963, when I assigned the name "quark" to the fundamental constituents
of the nucleon, I had the sound first, without the spelling, which could
have been "kwork." Then, in one of my occasional perusals of Finnegans
Wake, by James Joyce, I came across the word "quark" in the phrase "Three
quarks for Muster Mark." Since "quark" (meaning, for one thing, the cry of
a gull) was clearly intended to rhyme with "Mark," as well as "bark" and
other such words, I had to find an excuse to pronounce it as "kwork." But
the book represents the dreams of a publican named Humphrey Chimpden
Earwicker. Words in the text are typically drawn from several sources at
once, like the "portmanteau words" in Through the Looking Glass. From time
to time, phrases occur in the book that are partially determined by calls
for drinks at the bar. I argued, therefore, that perhaps one of the
multiple sources of the cry "Three quarks for Muster Mark" might be "Three
quarts for Mister Mark," in which case the pronunciation "kwork" would not
be totally unjustified. In any case, the number three fitted perfectly the
way quarks occur in nature.

Thomas Hobbes: He was 40 years old before he looked on geometry; which
happened accidentally. Being in a gentleman's library, Euclid's Elements
lay open, and "twas the 47 El. libri I" [Pythagoras' Theorem]. He read the
proposition . "By God", sayd he, "this is impossible:" So he reads the
demonstration of it, which referred him back to such a proposition; which
proposition he read. That referred him back to another, which he also read.
Et sic deinceps, that at last he was demonstratively convinced of that
trueth. This made him in love with geometry.

	The Proof of Fermat's Last Theorem

Needless to say, his talk was eagerly anticipated.  The day arrived, the
talk was given, and it was brilliant -- but it had nothing at all to do
with Fermat's Last Theorem.

After the talk, someone asked Hilbert why he had picked a title that had
nothing to do with the talk.  His answer: "Oh, that title was just in case

engineering.  Greatly concerned they decided to go back and talk to him.

After beating around the bush for a while they managed to convey to him
that they are worried that he may offend some people, and if he could sort
of hold back during his speech.

When Hilbert realized what they were asking he grinned broadly and said,

 Just a few trivial observations,

A funny thing that one notices in the course of learning particle physics
is the various signature nuances of various authors, they each seem to have
a favorite word or phrase that they use over and over.

For example if you begin your studies with the introductory text by Franz
Gross "Relativistic Quantum Mechanics and Field Theory" you will notice
that he loves the word "famous" and uses it very frequently throughout the
text - if you notice it very early on, it becomes ridulously funny as you
go along (in a weird sort of way)

The next step comes with the graduation to "Quantum Field Theory" by Micho
Kaku.  You can hardly turn a page without noticing his favorite phrase,
"highly non-trivial" is very copiously used.

Then finally when you have learned all of that preliminary stuff you begin
to read "Superstring Theory" or, in fact, any of the mountain of papers
written by Edward Witten, and you notice that you cannot go very far in one
of his introduction sections without noticing his favorite word -
"crucial".

Some physics-nerd grad student could develop a sort of twisted "Where's
Waldo" - type drinking game wherein one must take a drink everytime you
come across the word "crucial" in a Witten introduction.

At the very least it brings a chuckle or two into an otherwise difficult
read.

Well back to reading another "famous" and yet "highly non-trivial" paper,
"crucial" to my understanding of particle physics!

http://users.aol.com/s6sj7gt/mikerav.htm Poe, E.: Near A Raven

The poem below, which bears an uncanny similarity to a certain famous poem
by Edgar Allen Poe, is my latest and most difficult attempt at constrained
writing. Constrained writing is the art of constructing a work of prose or
poetry that obeys some artificially-imposed constraint. For example, there
are two published novels from which the letter 'e' is absent - Gadsby, by
Ernest Vincent Wright (1938), and La Disparition by George Perec (still in
print, and even available in a very recent English translation (A Void,
translated by Gilbert Adair) that also obeys the constraint!).

Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to figure out the
constraint imposed on this poem. The answer is given after the end, so if
you want to try to figure it out, just look at the beginning of the poem.

      Poe, E.
   Near A Raven

Midnights so dreary, tired and weary.  Silently pondering volumes extolling
all by-now obsolete lore.  During my rather long nap - the weirdest tap!
An ominous vibrating sound disturbing my chamber's antedoor.
    "This", I whispered quietly, "I ignore".

Perfectly, the intellect remembers: the ghostly fires, a glittering ember.
Inflamed by lightning's outbursts, windows cast penumbras upon this floor.
Sorrowful, as one mistreated, unhappy thoughts I heeded:
  That inimitable lesson in elegance - Lenore -
    Is delighting, exciting...nevermore.

Ominously, curtains parted (my serenity outsmarted), And fear overcame my
being - the fear of "forevermore".  Fearful foreboding abided, selfish
sentiment confided, As I said, "Methinks mysterious traveler knocks afore.
    A man is visiting, of age threescore."

Taking little time, briskly addressing something: "Sir," (robustly) "Tell
what source originates clamorous noise afore?  Disturbing sleep unkindly,
is it you a-tapping, so slyly?  Why, devil incarnate!--" Here completely
unveiled I my antedoor-- Just darkness, I ascertained - nothing more.

While surrounded by darkness then, I persevered to clearly comprehend.
  I perceived the weirdest dream...of everlasting "nevermores".  Quite,
quite, quick nocturnal doubts fled - such relief! - as my intellect said,
  (Desiring, imagining still) that perchance the apparition was uttering a
whispered "Lenore".
    This only, as evermore.

Silently, I reinforced, remaining anxious, quite scared, afraid,
  While intrusive tap did then come thrice - O, so stronger than sounded
afore.  "Surely" (said silently) "it was the banging, clanging window
lattice."
  Glancing out, I quaked, upset by horrors hereinbefore,
    Perceiving: a "nevermore".

Completely disturbed, I said, "Utter, please, what prevails ahead.
  Repose, relief, cessation, or but more dreary 'nevermores'?"  The bird
intruded thence - O, irritation ever since! -
  Then sat on Pallas' pallid bust, watching me (I sat not, therefore),
    And stated "nevermores".

Bemused by raven's dissonance, my soul exclaimed, "I seek intelligence;
Explain thy purpose, or soon cease intoning forlorn 'nevermores'!"
"Nevermores", winged corvus proclaimed - thusly was a raven named?
  Actually maintain a surname, upon Pluvious seashore?
    I heard an oppressive "nevermore".

My sentiments extremely pained, to perceive an utterance so plain,
  Most interested, mystified, a meaning I hoped for.  "Surely," said the
raven's watcher, "separate discourse is wiser.
  Therefore, liberation I'll obtain, retreating heretofore -
    Eliminating all the 'nevermores' ".

Still, the detestable raven just remained, unmoving, on sculptured bust.
  Always saying "never" (by a red chamber's door).  A poor, tender
heartache maven - a sorrowful bird - a raven!
  O, I wished thoroughly, forthwith, that he'd fly heretofore.
    Still sitting, he recited "nevermores".

The raven's dirge induced alarm - "nevermore" quite wearisome.
  I meditated: "Might its utterances summarize of a calamity before?"  O, a
sadness was manifest - a sorrowful cry of unrest;
  "O," I thought sincerely, "it's a melancholy great - furthermore,
    Removing doubt, this explains 'nevermores' ".

Seizing just that moment to sit - closely, carefully, advancing beside it,
  Sinking down, intrigued, where velvet cushion lay afore.  A creature,
midnight-black, watched there - it studied my soul, unawares.
  Wherefore, explanations my insight entreated for.
    Silently, I pondered the "nevermores".

"Disentangle, nefarious bird! Disengage - I am disturbed!"
   Intently its eye burned, raising the cry within my core.  "That
delectable Lenore - whose velvet pillow this was, heretofore,
  Departed thence, unsettling my consciousness therefore.
    She's returning - that maiden - aye, nevermore."

Since, to me, that thought was madness, I renounced continuing sadness.
  Continuing on, I soundly, adamantly forswore: "Wretch," (addressing
blackbird only) "fly swiftly - emancipate me!"

  "Respite, respite, detestable raven - and discharge me, I implore!"
    A ghostly answer of: "nevermore".

" 'Tis a prophet? Wraith? Strange devil? Or the ultimate evil?"
  "Answer, tempter-sent creature!", I inquired, like before.  "Forlorn,
though firmly undaunted, with 'nevermores' quite indoctrinated,
  Is everything depressing, generating great sorrow evermore?
    I am subdued!", I then swore.

In answer, the raven turned - relentless distress it spurned.
  "Comfort, surcease, quiet, silence!" - pleaded I for.  "Will my (abusive
raven!) sorrows persist unabated?
  Nevermore Lenore respondeth?", adamantly I encored.
    The appeal was ignored.

"O, satanic inferno's denizen -- go!", I said boldly, standing then.

  "Take henceforth loathsome "nevermores" - O, to an ugly Plutonian shore!
Let nary one expression, O bird, remain still here, replacing mirth.

  Promptly leave and retreat!", I resolutely swore.
    Blackbird's riposte: "nevermore".

So he sitteth, observing always, perching ominously on these doorways.
  Squatting on the stony bust so untroubled, O therefore.  Suffering stark
raven's conversings, so I am condemned, subserving,
  To a nightmare cursed, containing miseries galore.
    Thus henceforth, I'll rise (from a darkness, a grave) -- nevermore!

            -- Original: E. Poe
            -- Redone by measuring circles.

Solution:

Despite the rather difficult constraint (to be revealed shortly), observe
how this revised version of "The Raven" duplicates the story, tone, and
rhyme scheme of the original fairly closely (including the internal rhymes
in the first and third line of each stanza). The only major concession to
the form is that the original has six lines per stanza, with the fourth and
fifth lines usually being very similar. Due to the nature of the constraint
I imposed (revealed in the next paragraph), this would have been nearly
impossible to do. Therefore, this version eliminates the similar line in
each stanza.

Give up? Hint: Start at the very beginning (with the word 'Poe') and write
next to each word the number of letters it contains. Put a decimal point
after the first digit. Look at the first few digits (or more if, like me,
you know the first several hundred by heart).  Are you impressed yet?

Even given the rather difficult constraint, I was able to match the
original very closely in spots. The very first line, although its meter is
wrong, is surprisingly close. Others which are very close, even to the
point of using many of the same words, are stanza 4 line 5, stanza 6 line
3, stanza 7 line 4, and stanza 15, line 1.

Note the use of the term "blackbird" a couple of times. Though not,
strictly speaking, correct (a raven is a black bird, not a blackbird), the
term is particularly appropriate. It is a subtle reference to George
Perec's La Disparition, which contains another written-with-constraints
version of "The Raven" - in this case the constraint being "write it in
French without using the letter 'e'".  In the English translation of La
Disparition by Gilbert Adair, the poem is faithfully translated into
English, also without using letter 'e'. The English version of the poem is
titled (wait for it...) Black Bird!

The poem encodes the first 740 decimals of pi. The encoding rule is this: a
word of N letters represents the digit N if N<9, the digit 0 if N=10, and
two adjacent digits if N>10 (e.g., a 12-letter word represents the digit
'1' followed by '2').

A much less well-known example is this nice poem by Joseph Shipley (1960):

     But a time I spent wandering in bloomy night;
     Yon tower, tinkling chimewise, loftily opportune.
     Out, up, and together came sudden to Sunday rite,
     The one solemnly off to correct plenilune.

I believe that "Near a Raven" establishes the world record for length of a
pi mnemonic. I would be glad to hear of other wordy attempts, either in
prose or poetry. Perhaps someone would like to attempt a short story or a
novel?!

From: wald@math.uconn.edu (Kevin Wald)

It occurred to me that the technique used in the The Raven version for
representing 0, using 10-letter words, is a trifle inelegant; ideally, one
should use zero-letter words. Alas, these are in short supply in written
English and the best examples, numbers written in Arabic numerals, have a
tendency not to come up in poetry. Nonetheless, taking advantage of a
different commonly-used symbol, I've just completed the following (a
translation of Sappho's "Hymn to Aphrodite"):

   Now I pray, O queen Aphrodite on ornate chair,          
   Sly, death-shunning thunderer-progeny,                
   Devastate not my own emotions with aching or sorrow;

   Come the way formerly you, my plaints detecting, 
   Heard & in hurrying downward left 
   A begetter's mansion. A golden cabriolet 
 
   You harnessed; posthaste did finches impel 't &
   Wings vibrated by & enveloped Midgard 
   From firmament down unto lower midranges of sky, & 

   Arrived speedily. O milady, holy & eterne in splendor,
   Smiled ye & inquired wherefore lamenting resounds,
   Whence my distress, & 

   For what, signally, I'm heart-mad.    
   "Whom am I t' ensnare & seduce? 
   Whoever currently troubles ye, O poet?

   Rebuffer & offering-dumper shall I set to pursuing ye now, & 
   Giving thence many gifties; & transform now-unloving maid 
   Into adorer (& unwilling wooer, maybe)." &

   Speed likewise to me now, I entreat; my heart set again 
   Woelessly free, & whatever I so heartily wish achieved p.d.q., 
   Fulfill that thing, & be Psappho's ally.

 Reading the following, It would help to know Korean counting system:

Korean Counting System


Number 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Korean hana dul set net daseot yeoseot ilgop
yeodeol ahop Sino-K il i sam sa o yuk chil pal gu


And for zero, there is no Korean word for that, but there are two
Sino-Korean* reading: yeong and gong *Sino-Korean: Reading of Chinese
letters in Korean fashion.

Isn't it fairly nice that there are two readings for every number?  I think
Korean counting is a ideal system to make mnemonics!


Note. Since Korean is non-European language, it is hard to give an
one-to-one literal translation. And sentences for mnemonics are usually
very skewed, therefore it is impossible to give an literal
translation. (However, native speaker of Korean will understand every
proper meanings and silly nuances immediately...)


Root 3: I think this is the best one I've ever heard.

There is a mnemonic to memorize a value of root 3 in Korea:

han chi se du go o go in ne 1.  7 3 2 0 5 0 1 4

This sounds like 'hana chil set dul gong o gong il net', (especially when
you ignore the last consonants or vowel!)  meaning '1 7 3 2 0 5 0 1 4' in
Korean counting.

What this sentence means is quite meaningless: (Root 3) is coming after
counting one chi* (of whatever) *chi: Korean traditional measuring unit for
length.

After counting one chi (of whatever), root 3 will come to you. :)


Root 2: This one is fairly good, though digits aren't many.

wan ne wan ne dul il se 1.  4 1 4 2 1 3

For sure, this sounds like 'hana net hana net dul il set'.  which means '1
4 1 4 2 1 3' in Korean counting.

This sentence means: Coming! Coming! (something coming is) two!

After chanting this, the result is 'coming' of the root 'two'. :)


If I got more of these stuffs, I would send it, too.


P.S: Was it interesting? Perhaps it is boring for someone who knows nothing
about Korean... But I hope you enjoy this one.

PPS: I hope to recieve your short answer. Is my English O.K.?  This one is
my nearly first attempt to write an E-mail in English...

 I don't have a better one for the roots of quadratics, but I learned the
sine-cosine song for the sum and difference formulae.  (I'll describe it
here, but it works better if you can hear the chant.)

You memorize the formulae for the sine of a sum or difference on the first
line and the cosine on the second.  The chant goes "sine cosine cosine sine
cosine cosine sign sine sine" (the last three are a triplet -- done in the
same time as two of the previous) then fill in the angle names alternately
and the + and - signs as appropriate.  (That's the purpose of the 'sign' --
to remind you that if the angles are added, then the products of trig
functions are subtracted.)

I also learned a cute, no-brainer method of remembering the second
derivative test.  You'll see the trick if you draw a smiley face with +'s
for eyes and a frowning face with -'s for eyes.  (I don't really like to
teach this one, as I think that the students are better off understanding
what the sign of the second derivative tells us about the first, and what
that entails about the concavity of the function.  I usually mention it
during the review for the final exam, rather than the chapter test that
includes the second derivative test.

 Quotient rule for derivatives ala Cab Calloway: Hodehi minus hideho over hoho.

From: RM Mentock <mentock@mindspring.com>

 My brother gave me this one from his math professor.  It is a mnemonic for
the quotient rule, called the Heidi Ho, or Cab Calloway, mnemonic.  Hi
represents the numerator (high), Ho the denominator (low), and De is the
derivative operator.

Ho De Hi minus Hi De Ho over Ho Ho

Sometimes it's called the Santa Claus mnemonic.

From: ssw@hamlet.umd.edu (Susan Schwartz Wildstrom)
 My friend and colleague, Lynn Gruner (who teaches BC Calculus with me at
Walt Whitman HS in Bethesda, MD) has altered the quotient rule song that
we received some years back.  Her version (sung to OLD MACDONALD'S FARM)
goes like this:
        Lo-de-hi less hi-de-lo   EIEIO
        Then draw the line and down below   EIEIO
        With a dx here and a dy there
        Here a slope, yes there's hope, you can cope
        Denominator squared will go   EIEIO

I composed a chain rule "song" to the tune of Allouette, but it's too
long to be of much value as a mnemonic.  The point of the song certainly
underscores how the chain rule works, but it's not one you'd be likely to
remember.

        On another mathematical subject, Lynn also uses EIEIO as a
mnemonic for extracting roots and when the absolute value symbols are
required in the answer  Even Index, Even In yielding Odd  (exponents).

The first law - Inertia = I made up a hyphenated word "One - ertia"

openings of the three are upward - each side of the sideways three is
"equal and opposite"

place.

	"Most vegetarians eat meatsteak;
	[and] just some usually never partake."

"Meatsteak" is an archaism for "meat"; the medieval distinction between
"meat" and "steak" is that the former term was applied to _any_ staple in
the diet, whereas the latter is was we now associate with the word -- this
not-too-artificial-I-hope term allows the couplet to rhyme. Note that the
conjunction "and" may or may not be placed as the first word of the second
line to indicate the order of the Asteroid Belt amongst the planets, and
that the two lines distinguish the Terrestrials from the Jovians -- if you
discount Pluto, which may lose its planetary distinction in the near
future. ("MVEMJSUN"?)

It's for remembering whether current leads voltage or lags it in reactive

hence 'E L I'.  In capacitive ('C') circuits, it's the other way, so 'I C
E'.

I have a relatively good one

(albeit fairly useless) for remembering the order that the nuclear shells
get filled up as you add more nucleons to the nucleus:

spuds if pug dish of pig

If you write it down and then cross out all of the vowels except for the
final 'i' you get

spdsfpgdshfpig

and since you are worying about nuclear levels, you already know the
spectroscopic notation: spdfghi s=0, p=1, ... so if you start numbering
above these letters how many times the letter has occured, you get the
principal quantum number, and angular momentum of the energy states in the
order that they are filled:

11121212312312 spdsfpgdshfpig

(Remember that in nuclear shells the angular momentum can be greater than
the principal quantum number...)

her friends, an exercise which can make one feel like an incredible geek.

         Wherein the author relates the Tale of the Exploding Pen.

     Everyone who's taken high school chemistry probably has some
entertaining stories of experiments not included in the syllabus, myself
included. A friend and I did a great deal of spontaneous research in our
class involving myriad flame tests and chemical combinations "Mother Nature
never intended." I recall one time when the teacher left the room, and my
friend dashed into the storeroom in the back to see what he could filch. He
returned with a heaping handful of silver nitrate powder, which isn't
exactly recommended handling procedure for this chemical. When rapid
discomfort made him dispose of this material, the rest of us observed to
our amazement that his entire hand had turned silver. By the end of the day
it had turned purple. But all this, of course, is peripheral to the Tale of
the Exploding Pen.
     One day in Chemistry class we were using calcium metal, which reacts
with water to give off hydrogen gas and heat. This was definitely Nifty,
and I saved several pieces. It became a source of amusement to drop it in a
puddle of water and watch it bubble and sputter, then quickly hand it to
someone during a quiet class to provoke an alarmed bellow (the stuff got
pretty hot). By the afternoon I had one piece left, which I, based on
thought processes that now entirely elude me, stored, along with some
water, in my pen, one of those Bic Biros with the large white barrel and
detachable endcap. It soon slipped my mind that I'd done this, and I went
on my way to Biology class. Midway through class, we were wrapping up an
experiment, with the teacher giving a lecture and the class taking notes. I
was standing in the back of the room, writing down final data from our
petri dishes of E. Coli, when my pen exploded. It was very loud, louder
than a firecracker, and I looked up to see every face in the class staring
at me and the remnant of my pen with great alarm. The resulting silence was
finally broken when someone muttered "his pen exploded!" I tried to play it
cool, giving my pen as cursory an inspection as possible, as if this were a
frequent occurence of little concern, and returned to an extroadinarily
studious job of note-taking. The teacher just smiled and continued the
lecture in a bit; I guess he was used to this sort of thing.
     We had some other interesting experiences in this biology course,
including the development of Live Chicken Bowling, and the concealment of
chickens in people's personal belongings. In one class I remember, one of
the kids wadded up paper towels into a foot-wide ball, and for reasons I
don't fathom arrived at the decision to set it on fire when the teacher
left the room. Too late it occcurred to him that a large ball of fire is
fairly conspicuous in a classroom setting, so he stuffed it into the lab
drawer beside his desk just before the teacher returned. The sudden earnest
interest in the lecture he tried to demonstrate was not enough to distract
from the smoke rising from his desk, however, and he got in a significant
amount of trouble.
     But let me return once again to Chemistry class. In all, it was a
fairly boring class, and we even had to pursue non- flammable
entertainment. I programmed a Blackjack game on my pocket computer, and we
would pass it around the class for all to play. A lively betting pool would
sometimes start when the score got high. One day we managed to play a full
game of Risk in the back of the room during lecture. Some of us would spend
a half an hour at a stretch duplicating Muppet noises from Sesame Street
episodes: "Tiiiick Tooooock BrrrrrrrRING! Yupyupyupyup". Others would
interupt any rare quiet moments by yanking leg hairs from other guys
wearing shorts. None of this infantilism, however, can compare to the
mayhem related to me by one of my roommates that went on in his own high
school chemistry class.
     He had a particularly anarchic chem class that seemed to involve an
impressive amount of pyrotechnics. On one occassion, someone threw a
fist-sized chunk of potassium metal in a sink full of water, which
destroyed it (both sink and water) with a great shower of sparks. Another
time his classmates covered an entire desktop with infamous nitrogren
tri-iodide, an unstable compound made from ammonia and iodine that explodes
when touched, leaving purple stains. They detonated it by throwing a paper
airplane, blowing the top off the desk. In an act of tremendous stupidity,
they filled an entire liter beaker with the gray incendiary material from
sparklers, and when some fool tossed in a match, the resulting column of
fire burned holes in both the table and ceiling. In an extra-curriculur
adventure, they piled a mound of thermite they'd prepared in class on a
particularly despised person's driveway. When ignited, it blasted a foot
wide hole through the concrete and down to the dirt. Their most notable
"achievement", however, was placing in someone's locker in a dish of water
a large chunk of some unknown material that gives off noxious odors when
moist. He said that the resulting nauseating stench spread through the
entire school. One girl barfed in mid-sprint to the bathroom, and the
school had to evacuate the building and cancel classes for the rest of the
day. In an entire semester of Chemistry class, his only remotely
educational experience was learning to make soap, and he had to repeat the
subject here at Purdue, minus the pyrotechnics.

science pranks well.  (although our chem teacher was much to smart to ever
leave sodium of potassium where we could find it).

-Earth Science - learning to burn skin with a magnifying
        glass.  Also learned that chalk, when heated with
        a magnifying glass, will explode.
-Biology - Actively participated in an experiment to
        kill the mutant fish that lived in the aquarium.
        We tried everything - soda, windex, acid.  These
        guys were tough.  The other high point of bio
        was having a frog pee down my friend's arm, cool.
-Chemistry - In a neighboring school one of the hooligans
        superglued everything in the classroom.  The
        teacher was infuriated.  When he went to sit down
        he found that his chair was also stuck in place.
        He did succeed in moving it, only by removing the
        four floor tiles it was glued to.  My high school
        chem teacher was too scary to try anything fun on.
        I did manage to light a table on fire though.
-Physics - Our physics teacher was cool.  He let us form
        a line into the hall and use the power of the Van
        de Graph generator to shock passers by. hehe.  We
        also got to chop a large block of wood off his
        stomach to demonstrate inertia.  He taught us the
        'to every force there is an equal and opposite..'

                        The Best Teacher I Ever Had

Mr. Whitson taught sixth-grade science.  On the first day of class, he gave
us a lecture about a creature called the cattywampus, an ill-adapted
nocturnal animal that was wiped out during the Ice Age.  He passed around a
skull as he talked.  We all took notes and later had a quiz.

When he returned my paper, I was shocked.  There was a big red X through
each of my answers.  I had failed.  There had to be some mistake!  I had
written down exactly what Mr. Whitson said.  Then I realized that everyone
in the class had failed.  What had happened?

Very simple, Mr. Whitson explained.  He had made up all that stuff about
the cattywampus.  There had never been such an animal.  The information in
our notes was, therefore, incorrect.  Did we expect credit for incorrect
answers?

Needless to say, we were outraged.  What kind of test was this?  And what
kind of teacher?

We should have figured it out, Mr. Whitson said.  After all, at the very
moment he was passing around the Cattywampus skull (in truth, a cat's),
hadn't he been telling us that no trace of the animal remained?  He had
described its amazing night vision, the color of its fur and any number of
other facts he couldn't have known.  He had given the animal a ridiculous
name, and we still hadn't been suspicious.  The zeroes on our papers would
be recorded in his grade book, he said.  And they were.

Mr. Whitson said he hoped we would learn something from this experience.
Teachers and textbooks are not infallible.  In fact, on one is.  He told us
not to let our minds go to sleep, and to speak up if we ever thought he or
the textbook was wrong.

Every class was an adventure with Mr. Whitson.  I can still remember some
science periods almost from beginning to end.  One day he told us that his
Volkswagen was a living organism.  It took us two full days to put together
a refutation he would accept.  He didn't let use off the hook until we had
proved not only that we knew what an organism was but also that we had the
fortitude to stand up for the truth.

We carried our brand-new skepticism into all our classes.  This caused
problems for the other teachers, who weren't used to being challenged.  Our
history teacher would be lecturing about something, and then there would be
clearings of the throat and someone would say "Cattywampus."

If I'm ever asked to propose a solution to the crisis in our schools, it
will be Mr. Whitson.  I haven't made any great scientific discoveries, but
Mr. Whitson's class gave me and my classmates something just as important:
the courage to look people in the eye and tell them they are wrong.  He
also showed us that you can have fun doing it.

Not everyone sees the value in this.  I once told an elementary school
teacher about Mr. Whitson.  The teacher was appalled.  "He shouldn't have
tricked you like that," he said.  I looked at the teacher right in the eye
and told him he was wrong.

As a kid in 9th grade, my first real science class where we got to do
things with bunsen burners and chemicals, instead of just watching tubes of
beef broth rot, my teacher was demonstrating how to make and collect
ammonia gas. Holding the flask upside down over the output tube, nothing
happened. He said something like 'you all think that nothing has happened
here, I take it?' and called me up. He said sniff the flask, and having
forgotten the lesson of 'Don't lean over to sniff', I leaned over to
sniff. Several minutes later, my eyes stopped watering, the class stopped
laughing, and the teacher said 'Thank you for a demonstration both of the
fact that there IS ammonia gas, and the INCORRECT way to detect it.'

He was cool...<grin> That class was a lot of fun...

When I was in high school, I had an awesome biology instructor, Mr. Mateka,
or Teak as we called him. When a freshman, he went somewhere for a
conference and left us a sub who knew nothing about biology. He was under
the assumption that we would get at least a sub who knew something about
science, so he gave us these really long assignments. However, the sub
wouldn't let us out of our seats to get the books to do the assignments.
After the three days, our teacher found that there were no books left in
the room. There were a good 10 bookcases in that room, and we managed to
hide all of the books. There were some in the ceiling, under the lab tables
on the water and gas lines, underneath tables, in places that haven't been
looked at in years. When he came back, he actually understood that we
couldn't find the answers. 5 years later, they are still finding books.

In the same instructors class, we had a lab ghost. This was the thing that
we blamed when our labs wouldn't work, the computer was down, or anything
else went wrong. Our senior year we decided to personify the ghost. Before
spring break we hooked up the lab aprons from the ceiling, disconnected the
lights, hooked up an oscillating fan and a strobe light, and tied water
filled rubber gloves to all knobs and handles that would open a
door. Monday morning after break, the janitors turned on the power at about
6:30 am. With the strobe, the classroom from the outside was VERY
noticeable. The janitors were afraid to enter the room. When the instructor
finally did, he was very impressed with our skills. It was very interesting
to see his face. The only comment he made, was that it was more appropriate
for Halloween.  He was the person that inspired me to become a teacher.

Our chemistry teacher was demonstrating to us the alkali metals. Being year
10 (14 year old) students we knew they were only _meant_ to use a rice
grain sized lump. Anyway, we encouraged him to put in large lumps. At the
end, he got fairly large lumps of each and chucked them all into the water
at once. The potassium exploded and burning fragments melted holes in my
pen, burnt my book and the floor. It also burned a hole about a cm across
into a text book. After the lesson he went to boast to all the other
chemistry teachers!!

The same teacher was demontrating rates of reaction. He put some hydrogen
peroxide into a conical flask and added several large drops of blood from a
jar of chicken livers to it. He put a bung in (this was connected to a gas
syringe). The reaction started and soon a white froth was pushing up the
rubber tubing and into the gas syringe. then with a _very_ loud pop, the
bung flew out and he was left covered in this white gunk. The whole class
laughed for about 5 minutes!

The same chemistry teacher poored ethanol on the bench and lit it. He also
writes messages in ethanol and lights them. He attaches rubber tubing to a
gas tap, lights it and waves it around the class without a care.

All the chemistry teachers at our school have a competiton. They pour water
into a coffee tin, hammer the lid on and put a bunsen under it. They try to
make the largest dent in the ceiling. This is especially diffficult in
biology labs where the ceiling is about 12-foot high.

Our physics teacher told us that when he was training as a teacher, he had
electrolyised some water. He then oppened the two taps and lit the combined
hydrogen and oxygen - and deafened the whole class!

Our maths teacher refuses to use the same variable mor than once in one
lesson so we often end up using smiley-face as a variable

At last!! A use for graph theory!! We simply calculate the maximum spanning
tree to get from one classroom to another and thus miss most of the boring
lessons.

  When I was in High School, one of my classmates was having a serious
problem with people stealing his lunch.  Every day it disappeared from his
locker (don't recall whether his lock was broken off or what.)  Complaining
to the principal did no good, so he went to his father, a pharmacist.
  His father gave him some substance (Silver Nitrate) which didn't discolor
the food, but which turned your skin black or purple when you came in
contact with it.
  This guy liberally coated his food with it, and waited.  I was fortunate
enough to see the results.
 Another classmate, who had ostensibly gone to the bathroom, returned to
the math class, hiding his hands and face as best he could.  It didn't work
- his dyed skin was obvious.  A cohort of his didn't even bother to return
to class, he just fled the school for the day.

 I remember my 10th grade highschool chem 1 class.  I was a prety
intelligent person at the time, for my age.  One day we decided to play a
prank on the class, scared the shit out of the whole bunch of them.  Took
some potassium, a beaker, a very large baloon, and a lighter.  Stuck some
water, and potassium in the baker, and placed the baloon over it.. We all
know that will produce hydrogen, so we let the baloon off the beaker,
closed it off, and let it be passed around the room for a while.  The
teacher started to get curious about what we were doing (he couldn't see us
doing this).  We finally decided to light it up, right in the middle of a
small chapter test.  Letting the baloon go, someone stuck it with one of
those grill lighters.  The baloon exploded into a large ball of fire, and
an interesting noise followed.  The smartass who lit it up had no hair on
his arms anymore, and we had no grade in chem 1.  ohwell.

When I was in High School, my chemistry teacher had the privilege of
scaring most of the freshman chem class.  He had a wooden cutting block set
out on the bench at the front of the class, with a large butcher's knife.
After everyone took their seats, he produced an apple, two 200 mL beakers
containing clear fluid, an empty 500 mL beaker, and an eye dropper.  He
proceeded to cut the apple in half, and then place the knife back in a
locked drawer (he didn't trust us!).  With the dropper, he squirted some of
liquid A onto one half of the apple, and we all saw it eat away at the
apple rather quickly.  Then, after rinsing the dropper, he squirted some of
liquid B onto the remaining half of the apple, which also ate it away.  He
then poured liquid A and liquid B into the 500 mL beaker, and swirled the
mixture for a few moments (about twenty seconds).  He then downed the whole
thing in one big swallow!

As it turned out, liquid A was hydrocloric acid, and liquid B was sodium
hydroxide.  They were both of the same molarity, and so when mixed, they
produced salt water.  The most interesting happening of this was the next
year, when a young lady passed out as the teacher swallowed his drink...

 This prank is very similar to one you have listed, except it backfired.
Our high school chemistry teacher used equal molarity solutions of HCl and
NaOH, mixed them and drank them in front of class. While he did not burn
his gullet, he did use phenothalene as the indicator. He later learned (or
remembered) that phenolthalene is the main ingredient in many laxatives and
paid dearly for his mistake over the next several days.

 When I was in high school I pulled off this particular prank.  This one
guy in the class was always pissing me off, so I conspired to make a fool
of him in front of the class.  The next day during chem lab, we were
informed that we would be using concentrated sulfuric acid, which is clear.
Anyway, during the lab, I took the beaker full of sulfuric acid (and this
is the kind of stuff that burns through flesh) and hid it behind a desk.  I
then filled an identical beaker full of steaming-hot, but not burning-hot
water.  I used a wax pencil to write on the outside.  'Concentrated
Sulfuric Acid'.  Then I walked over to this guy that was pissing me off and
got his attention.  I took a medicine dropper, filled it with the stuff
(which he thought was acid) and shot it all over his face.  It was hot
water, so he thought he was burning!  He started screaming, 'Cj threw acid
on me!!!' And promptly began thrashing and shrieking.  Everyone stared at
me.  Then I held the beaker aloft, threw my head back and drank the whole
thing.  The teacher nearly dropped dead on the spot.  The rest you can just
imagine.  --CJ Calo

Ammonium tri-iodide is an extremely fun chemical.  But you have to be
careful.  My chem prof played a really cool joke on this really annoying
bastard in my class.  Real pop-off, and he deserved it.  You simply fix
iodine crystals (expensive) and ammonia (roughtly as much as the crystals
can dissolve into).  While it is liquid, it's reasonably safe.  Don't use
more than a drop on anything, since it will explode once it's dry, and can
be dangerous.

However, when placed on a countertop in a very small amount, the first
person to touch it gets quite a surprise and a stain on their skin and
doesn't come off easily.  Hilarious actually.  I've only made it once,
though.

I know that this doesn't really count as a "prank", but once in high school
chem we were doing potassium experiments, and there were 36 students (so
there were 37 people including the teacher).  Each student has 20 test
tubes full of water and into each one he or she places a small amount of
potassium (the experiment was supposed to test the production of hydrogen.)
After the experiment, each person puts the test tubes into a central trash
can (for those of you slow in math, that's 740 test tubes EACH ONE of which
is pumping out hydrogen.)  Later on we were doing tests with glowing
splints, and the teacher said "don't put a burning splint into the trash
can" (for obvious reasons) Well, one girl thought that a glowing splint
(not burning) would be ok.  All I can say is that the column of red flame
was more spectacular than any movie nuclear blast!  In fact, to this day (6
years later), there is still a very large burn mark on the ceiling of that
classroom.

Another one with the same teacher was another potassium mishap.  Since
potassium cannot be stored in water, it is stored in a sort of oil.  Well,
he took a golf-ball size chunk and held it in is hand as he cut it.  Un-
fortunately, the oil was slippery and the chunk fell into the beaker.
Well, what happened was that the beaker EXPLODED and impaled the teacher
with several bits of glass (he was in hospital for a day or two) and the
desk was strewn with a hundred or so pock-marks.

However, one real prank was with the SAME teacher was in order to keep
sanity and good behaviour in class, he would keep 2 squirt guns with him.
One with water, and the other with SILVER NITRATE SOLUTION.  (this stuff
looks just like water but it turns skin BLACK on contact) He shot about 4
people during the year, but only one girl (the same one with the hydrogen)
got the silver nitrate (on the FACE!!!).

Finally, this was one I did in college.  My first year in the dorms, I
would keep a bottle of root beer which someone would continually drink
without my knowing.  After I couldn't stand it anymore, I went to a friend
in the chem dept. and asked him for an acid/base indicator that turns base
pink (I forget what the indicator was), and put a bit in my root beer
bottle.  The plan was that human urine is somewhat base, so when the
culprit drank my root beer, he began to pee pink.  Needless to say, about
12 hours later, this guy thought he was gonna die!

        Well I am a Medical Technologist, and through the years in the
field we have pulled some good jokes. One of the funny ones I can remember
is a day when I was working in Hematology. One of the other techs, that was
working in Chemistry, was this real whining hypochondriac. Well he came
over to me telling me that he felt really sick and was wondering if I would
run A CBC and Differential on him. So I drew his blood and labeled it and
it to hematology and ran it.. It was normal as normal could be, but I
decided to have a bit of fun. Earlier in the day a known CLL patient had
been in and gave some blood, so I took one of the extra tubes, poured it
into a new tube and labeled it with this techs info (making sure to make a
mark as to not confuse the real sample up). Well I ran the CLL pt. blood
and made a smear, then I went over to him and said "you had better take a
look at this". He came over and looked at the results and then looked at
the smear, and went a bit pale and said that I must have mixed it up, with
somebody else. So I gave him the falsely labeled tube and he ran it himself
getting the same results. You should have seen his face I thought he was
gonna Die right there! Anyway I let him suffer for about 2 min. or so then
gave him the real results and from the look on his face I though I was
gonna die!

  What follows is not an invented joke, but a true story, although I may
have embellished it a little over many years of telling. "Sister Karen" was
a nun and a Chemistry teacher who had come to work on her Master's degree
with my now retired colleague Prof Herbert Meislich , who happens to be
Jewish. Her first task was to monobrominate a ketone. She added her Br2,
and started the stirrer as instructed....nothing happened ..... STILL no
decolorisation...... after some time she is getting worried, and asks
another student, who told her - "See that man over there - that's Prof
McKelvie, ask him" A slightly out of breath nun comes up to me - "Prof
McKelvie? My reaction won't work !" My evil mind was thinking WHICH of her
reactions was not working, but that's another story. ) Anyway, I could have
told her that bromination is dependent on making the enol, and this is
promoted ny acid, so that the HBr produced will aid enolisation and all
will be well. BUT - that morning I'd found on the floor a Star of David
that had fallen off some Jewish girl's neck, and I'd been looking for the
owner... INSPIRATION! - the problem is that you've had the wrong
theoretical training ! Just a moment ....I tied the Star of David around
her apparatus, added a few drops of hydrochloric acid just to help things
along, and announced that NOW it would work in five minutes ! It took four
minutes and 50 seconds by my watch. "SEE?!" She had the brains and a good
Irish sense of humour to realise she was being "had", and I explained that
it was her Organic Chemistry that was being deficient, not theology......

(Aftermath - two Jewish girls came down from upstairs and wanted to borrow
the gold chain so that THEIR reactions would work better........)

This is a beaker of horse urine. The simplest way to determine if the horse

 When in high school, a chemistry professor was giving us a lecture on
qualitative analysis of a substance. He mentioned color, consistency,
weight, taste, etc., admonishing us to exercise our powers of observation
above all.  He pulled a small beaker of yellowish liquid from under the
bench and began to call out its characteristics.

"This is a sample of some urine from my goat (yes, he had a pet
goat...). If you will notice, it is a liquid, somewhat yellowish in color,
but translucent." He then thrust his hand down into the beaker, rapidly
withdrawing it and sticking a finger in his mouth, ostensibly tasting the
liquid.

We gasped; one started retching. He then explained. "I mentioned
'observation,' ladies and gentlemen. If you had been oberving closely, you
would have seen me insert my index finger in the urine and then lick my
middle finger."

 In my freshman chemistry class (many years ago), the first day was
allocated to a talk about chemistry (what it is, why it's important, how it
affects our lives, blah, blah, blah). To illustrate this talk, Doc carried
in two beakers filled with clear liquids. As he progressed through the
talk, he would ocassionally pick up one of the beakers and swirl it (Thus
confirming that it really was filled with a liquid). Toward the end of the
talk, he would pick up both beakers and swirl them. Next, he would start
pouring the liquids from one beaker into the other repeatedly (Thus really
proving that they contained liquids). Finally, he would walk around the
podium, while still swirling the beaker containing both sets of contents,
and stop in front of some glazed-eyed student. As he finished his lecture
with the statement 'This is why chemistry is important to you.', he would
slosh the beaker toward the student, who never failed to dive for cover. Of
course, the chemicals had reacted and formed a gelatin which stuck to the
bottom of the beaker. Therefore nothing came out.

Well, at least, that's the way it was supposed to work. The next year, one
of the graduate students intercepted Doc on the way to the class, and
switched beakers with him, replacing one of the chemicals with water. I'm
not sure who was more surprised that year, the student who ended up with a
lap full of chemicals, or Doc.

P.S. He should have known something was up, what with all of the graduate
students clustered outside of the classroom door...

P.P.S. I actually witnessed the 'dry' version of the trick, but I wasn't
lucky enough to have witnessed the 'wet' version, although I did hear about
it from several (many) credible witnesses.

  My dad told me this one and I absolutely MUST see someone try it again.
His Chem professor was showing the awesome powers of liquid nitrogen (not
to be attempted at home) where a banana is used to hammer in a nail and a
balloon shatters when hit with a frozen rose. However, the best prank of
all with liquid nitrogen has to be this one.
  Before the prank is pulled (or before the class fills up), a Vienna
sausage is placed in the finger of a rubber glove and set on the table.
Then a bowl of liquid nitrogen is obtained. Now when the students file in
they will think everything is typical.
   After the balloon and banana trick with the liquid nitrogen the teacher
puts his hand into the rubber glove and tries to remember which one he
placed the Vienna sausage in. Next he dips THAT finger in the liquid
nitrogen, grabs a hammer, and smashed the frozen Vienna sausage. This will
make it look as if real meat is flying across the room.
   My dad said that several girls in the class passed out after this prank,
so make sure the students are situated near the floor to prevent any
injuries. Hope you enjoy the prank.

 At my high school, all of the science classes were held in a separate
building.  The architects had probably dealt with students like us before.
My Physics teacher junior year was very knowledgeable, but very
unobservant.  At the beginning of the semester, we took advantage of this
by playing paper football (folding a piece of notebook paper into a
triangle and flicking it between your opponents fingers used as "goal
posts") during his lectures.  So many people were doing this that by
midterms we had to have a superbowl.  We started feeling ignored and
decided to pull a prank.  We were normal kids and craved attention, even
the negative attention that would be attracted by playing a prank on
Mr. 'S'.  It started off very simple and safe, as these things usually do.
The plan was just to slip a book underneath the teacher's desk on the side
facing us and see if he would notice.  Sitting in the front row, I was a
collaborator.  When the teacher stepped into the storeroom I took my
partner's fairly thick physics book (we as students weren't using them
anyway) and slipped it under the edge of the table while my partner exerted
a considerable amount of effort tilting the table.  These were all-purpose
desks used for Chemistry, Biology and Physics and their wooden sides went
all the way to the floor.  Upon Mr. S's return, he set his ever-present
coffee cup down and continued the lecture, of course not noticing he now
had the complete attention of the whole class.  He also didn't notice the
tilted table.  No papers moved and his cup didn't slide or spill.  Being
good Physics students, we determined the desk did not have enough tilt.
Upon Mr. S's next departure from to the storeroom (for more coffee?), we
tried to slip another book on top of the first one under the side of the
table.  I, again, was the collaborator in charge of placement, but this
time it took the entire front row to tilt the table enough, and I had to
jam the book into place.  After placement, the table looked very distorted,
and there was an unspoken thought to use a smaller book.  Too late, the
lookout was waving.  Quickly resuming our seats, Mr. S again set his cup
down and continued the lecture.  His only clue that there was something
wrong was the scraping of his coffee cup sliding down the all-purpose
surface.  He managed to catch the cup as it cleared the edge not spilling a
drop.  He first inspected the underside of the cup (looking for what?
legs?  rocket engines?) and then brushed the desk with his hand.  Finding
nothing, he stepped back and squinted at the desk, but from that angle the
table still looked normal.  All this time there is dead silence from us
students.  We still had a shot at undoing it all during his next coffee
break if he didn't figure it out.  One giggle would give it away.
Unprompted, Mr. S walked around to the side of the table and again
squinted.  The jig was up.  The books were in plain view so he pointed and
said, "Get those books out of there!"  All of us collaborators got up as
the others laughed, and pushed against the desk, but the books were wedged
in there good.  Mr. S call "Maz" down from the back of the room.  Maz was
the only football player in the class.  He put his back against the table
and with us pushing, we tilted the table far enough to remove the books.
There was a great amount of creaking and groaning from the old table and as
I removed the books, there was a loud "nnnnnnnnnnnnSNAP".  All of us
students immediately knew that a pipe supplying all of the faucets with gas
had sheared, but Mr. S waited for the "shshshshshshshsh" and said, "Do you
hear that?"  We didn't wait for permission and cleared out of the room
while Mr. S investigated the source of the hissing.  Outside, we got what
we thought would be a non-lethal distance, but not safe distance from the
science building because we wanted a good view when it exploded.  It never
did and we were very disappointed.

 I remember this one too, except a piece of white chalk was inserted
into the middle of a raw hotdog, which was then placed into the index
finger of a rubber glove.  After dipping the gloved "finger" into the
liquid nitrogen (and commenting on how this demo could only be performed
once), the instructor then proceeded to break the finger off at the base
with a sickening "SNAP!", revealing the white "bone" in the middle of the
severed finger, and noting how remarkable it was that no pain was actually
felt.  Quite an eye opener, I must say!

* A friend of mine at U of Chicago once calculated the resonant frequency
of his dorm's stairwells, bought a test record with that tone on it and
played it into the stairwells from a number of stereos.  Apparently had the
entire building shaking visibly before they got scared enough to turn it
off.

* I had a friend who lived in a room next to the study lounge.  The night
before finals, I invited him up to my room and then phoned his room,
letting the phone ring until the angry mob in the study lounge broke down
the door and ripped the phone off the wall.

* Ran an imaginary student for a student government position.  He was named
after a dog.  He didn't actually make the ballot because his false ID was
discovered by the administration, but he still won on write-in votes.

* I once learned the day before that a professor would be late to one of
his classes the next day.  I made up a "pop quiz" that was incredibly hard,
and then showed up and handed it out to the class, telling them that I was
a grad student the prof had sent to proctor.

* A friend and I put on surgical greens, masks, booties and so on, and then
splashed red food coloring on ourselves.  Then we burst into the medical
library, arguing loudly, and go over to the reference copy of Gray's
Anatomy.  I leaf through it, peer at a picture, and point and say
triumphantly "See, I *told* you it was on the left side.  What are you,
dyslexic?"  My friend looks abashed, shrugs, and we walk out.

* One that I never got a chance to do: Wait until someone brings a cute
little puppy on to campus.  Then, later that day, rush onto the dorm floor
with the puppy wrapped in a bloodstained blanket.  Explain to everyone that
the dog was hit by a car and it has a large sliver of glass in its side.
You don't think it will live long enough to get it to a vet, so you're
going to pull the sliver yourself and try and stop the bleeding.  Go into
your room (with the pet owner) and close the door.  Play a previously
prepared tape of a dog whining and barking in pain, and say things like
"Jesus Christ!  Hold it still!  Oh, shit, I'm going to be sick.  What the
hell is *that*?"  and so on.  (I couldn't find the sound effect on the day
the puppy was there.)

I had moved from Utah to California between my sophomore and junior years.
Before leaving Utah, a teacher hosted a physics "demo" to entice students
to take the class the next year.  One of the experiments involved a Van de
Graaf generator.

I remembered that experiment and warnings made during it, when our physics
teacher left the room 2 years later, and the students took to playing with
another such device in our own room.  I said that I would show them how it
was done.  I pulled off my metal frame glasses, stood on a wooden chair and
placed my hands on the bulbous top.  A fellow student started it up, and
before long my hair stood out, making me look like a porcupine.

Well, it started with a threat to not turn the machine off.  I had been
told that you could get a big shock by pulling your hands off the device,
and so I pleaded with the other students to turn it off before the teacher
got back.

That wasn't good enough.  Someone grabbed a big metal wand, used normally
to discharge the static, and tried insulating themselves.  Why?  I don't
know.  Anyway, it didn't work.  They started poking me with the wand,
causing bolts of electricity to fly between the wand and me.

They walked behind me.  Zap, Zap, Zap.  They hit different parts of my head
and back.

Then they stooped to a lower level.  They aimed for a spot just below the
waist, between my legs.  You men know about this... :-)

I was getting pretty desperate, and still kept my hands firmly planted on
the bulb at the top.  I must have looked like a wrigglying python to this
fellow student's snake charming "wand".

He crept closer, trying to shock me "down there".  I was getting pretty
frantic, and finally reached out with one hand to swipe at his head....

....and a huge spark launched from my finger and struck him in the
forehead.  He didn't like that!

Years later, at a state fair, a young kid was touching a gizmo that had
little "plasma lightning" strikes reach out from a high voltage core out to
the glass, where people would attract the bolts with their fingers.

Apparently, this kid found that he could shock others, and started doing
so.  It was annoying, and probably something relating to the above incident
had to be resolved.  I reached out and pointed to his ear.  A bolt lept
out.  He, for some reason, didn't want to let go of the device he was
holding on to, and I continued to point to his ears.  I would leave, and
he'd resume shocking others, so I'd get close and give him a quick zap.  He
didn't understand how I could shock him, while I wasn't touching that
globe.  I dunno.... :-) Maybe *I* was the ground path???

                      FOOLISH HABIT OF SMELLING CHEMICALS

Perhaps foolishly, I've smelled quite a few compounds in my years in the
lab.  I just happen to enjoy smells of all kinds.  The oddest was a methoxy
cyclobutannulated aromatic compound that smelled exactly like cardboard.
Or, more precisely, the inside of a dusty, musty cardboard box.  Complete
with that dry feeling in the back of the nose.  Then there was the
substituted vinylcyclopropyl iodide that smelled exactly like artificial
watermelon flavoring.  Then there's the time in high school that I found a
bottle of Br2 in a prep room. (I think you probably see where this is
going.)  I thought, "Ooh, cool red vapors.  That must smell really good."
My only experience smelling halongens to that point was I2, which, to my
thinking, actually did smell purple.  So I thought that red bromine vapors
would smell, well, red...whatever that meant.  Anyway, I got a pretty good
lungful.  Breathing returned to normal several hours later.  Mr. Chiudioni
didn't even bat an eyelash.  This followed fairly closely on the heels of
my ill-fated attempt to make nitroglycerine (I found glycerine, I found
nitric acid, and I found sulfuric acid.  Put 2 and 2 and 2 together.  Got a
huge yellow nitric acid stain on the 12' high ceiling.)  To this day, I
still haven't learned my lesson--still smell nearly everything, unless I
have a notion that it might be not-so-good for me.

Barry Sharpless used to publicly claim to have smelled every single
compound he's ever made, and also claims to have tasted a large fraction of
them.  He said that the oddest smell he ever experienced was the compound
(I forget what it was) that smelled exactly like a blow to the back of the
head.  Or maybe that was the floor rushing up at him that made it resemble
a blow to the back of the head.

The lesson is clear.  Unless you are damn sure you know what you're doing
(a Ph.D. and about 20 total years in chemistry labs of one kind or another
is barely enough in my case, I'm afraid) DO NOT smell things willy nilly.
I know very well I've been lucky.  It just ain't worth it.  Unless, like
me, you feel that, because you are a chemist, you will inevitably die of
liver cancer some day.

My high-school physics teacher was a real ass - so my class felt a moral
obligation to do whatever it could to make his life "more interesting"....

We did the usual things to his car (blocks, siphoned the gas, reported it
stolen while he was out drving it, etc.).  But one of our best was a
pratical application of the optics lessons...

Our class was usually the first one of the day - and our classroom had a
huge bank of windows along the eastern wall.  Our teacher was also very
precise - he used to always stack papers, especially tests, at one
particular spot on his lab bench at the front of the class.

We had a test coming up on day, so the afternoon before, a group of us
asked if we could use the classroom for a group study session.  What
teacher in their right mind would turn down students who WANTED to study?
Of course, we didn't study - we rigged a series of mirrors to bounce the
sunlight (remember those windows?) onto a parabolic mirror that was exactly
focused onto the spot the teacher used to stack his papers on.

Next day, teacher arrives, places test papers on desk an starts to lecture
us about the test process, etc.  He'd been nattering for about 30 seconds
when the whole stack of tests burst into flames and tripped the lab's
alarms.

Funniest part, the twerp never realized what we'd done -- he was sure it
was a case of spontaneous combustion....

 Before a chemistry demonstration, in my high school chemistry class, a
student (not me) connected the gas outlet and water outlet with a section

off and waited.  Our teacher was very upset when he turned on the gas
outlet to the Bunsen burner and got only water.

I am a petroleum geologist and went to college at the University of
Wisconsin. The cadre of geology grad students and post-docs used to all go
to the Student Union "GastHaus" to decompress after a particularly nasty
week of TA'ing and RA'ing, exams, et al. We'd all take turns buying
pitchers of beer, so one could down quite a few beers quite cheaply.

Although, not as cheaply as some others.

One character, who shall remain properly nameless, was a "beer
scrounge". He'd show up, drink our beer, but never buy a round when his
time rolled around.

Well, in Optical Petrology class, there's this little test to distinguish
between low-magnesium and high-magnesium clacite, dolomite and ankerite
(typical carbonate minerals); and this was to stain the polished and etched
thin section with an organic dye called Alizarian Red. Well, AR is
odorless, colorless and tasteless. It will also color a person's urine
blood red.

So...

Properly nameless showed up one evening and proceeded to drink up a fair
share of beer. Whilst he was in the head, we spiked his beer with AR. He
came back and drank down a rather generous portion of beer, not knowing why
we weren't complaing about his chintziness.  Well, after 6 or so more
beers, nameless wanders off to answer nature's call yet again. He was
semi-lit up and having just a LARGE time, laughing and joking all the way.

When nameless returned to our table, he was as white as a fish-belly, eyes
as big as dinner plates and he was mumbling something about "I'm gonna
die...I'm gonna die..."

We did tell him 2 days later that his beer was spiked.

 The best prank I ever played on my chem teacher was phony mercury.  I had
noticed in a grocery store that there were small silvery bead-like cake
decorations.  They came in several mesh sizes and looked very much like
mercury droplets.  I went back to the store without my mom and bought a
container of each size.  By the time I was in chemistry class, the '70's,
mercury was already recognized as dangerous.  Only the teacher could use it
and spills were a serious incident.  By the way, I understand the
confections are were made with an incredibly thin layer of actual silver
leaf over the sugar pill core.

Anyhow, I waited until a test day to scatter the cake decorations all over
the instructor's table and sink.  He took one look and evacuated the
lab/classroom.  The tests were inside, locked in the prep room as usual.
With all the confusion it was not until three fourths of the period was
over that the instructor touched one of the phony droplets with a lab
spatula and discovered it was solid.  I had bought an extra day to study
with this little trick.

 During a final exam in inorganic chem lab at Columbia, maybe forty years
ago, we were all handed a dry powder and told we had three hours to
determine what was in it. We knew how to do it, too. All except for one
poor guy, the best student in the class, whose sample had become a
carbonized bubbling mess that stank up the whole rest of the room.  The
instructors hung around the fringe of the room barely hiding their glee.
They let the poor dupe agonize for nearly an hour, as he watched his
attempts to ace the course turn to goo before his eyes, before they
revealed that his sample had been an ounce of Betty Crocker Fudge Brownie
Baking Mix.  They told him later that they would have excused him entirely
from the final exam, but that they just could not resist the opportunity.

   Note for non-americans: Betty Crocker is an imaginary woman in an apron,

                       SHAVING CREAM IN LIQUID NITROGEN

 From: Smokey Joe (stdddm12@shsu.edu)

Get cans of shaving cream and place them in liquid nitrogen until
frozen. Take them out and peel off the can, leaving the solid white mass
inside. Throw x number of these white masses into the cab of someone's
truck. When the temperature rises, they should expand(I've never gotten to
try it, myself).

From: Tragic Comic <vyperhunt@hotmail.com> In fact, the frozen shaving
cream block effectively seals the aersol in as well, so as it thaws, the
aersol expands along with the cream.  two to three blocks can completely
fill a car interior.

From: Mike Painter (mpainter@inreach.com) 

My guess would be that they would thaw out and leave a puddle on the seat.
(See Tragic Comic's remark above for a denial)

Now if you put one in a footlocker so that closing the lid pushes the
button you get the proper result.  What is nice about this is that after
everything clears up there is almost nothing left in the box but a few thin
white lines.

From: Richard Filmer <rfilmer@rocketmail.com>

Regarding the shaving cream prank, I also believe it will fail. The tin
casing of the can will become brittle long before the high-pressure inert
gas will freeze, thus shooting shards of cold metal into your face.

From: Victor Bajanov <victor@bajanov.dropbear.id.au>

Although I've never tried this, tin has another allotrope: a white
powder. It changes into this form at about -40 degrees Celsius (-40
Farenheit as well). Nitrogen boils at about -70 C (-94 F), so liquid
nitrogen would be below this temperature. So yes, the tin casing of the
can, if indeed the can is made of tin, would turn to powder long before the
pressurised gas froze.

From: "Ironclad Taco" <scones@fish.co.uk>
 
I didn't think that cans were made out of tin anymore. I thought the
preffered metal was aluminium, which, to my knowledge (absoloutly
miniscule) does not turn brittle like tin.

My favorite was when one professor put another inside a Faraday cage at
very high voltage when he was allegedly there just to help be sure the demo
was done correctly, using a volunteer from the other prof's class.  Instead
he said "Hey, he's been telling you all this stuff is true, shouldn't he be

I recall a practical

demonstration of induction. Each student was issued an iron-cored inductor
fitted with a pair of 4mm sockets, a 1.5 volt dry cell, and two pieces of
insulated wire, each with a 4mm plug on one end and a bare crocodile
(alligator) clip on the other. The instructions were simple: connect them
in series. Naturally they inserted the plugs in the sockets and took a clip
in each hand to touch against the ends of the cell. Nothing apparently
happened...

I love it!  What a maliciously

delightful bastard!

Reminds me of the time when, as a co-op student, I decided to check the
resistance of the high side winding on a power company pole transformer
using a hand-held Simpson 260 VOM (set on a low-Ohms scale).  "Odd", I
thought to myself, "the resistance is decreasing, and rather slowly."  It
didn't take long to be taught why the "resistance is changing", but
painfully.

Lessons like these are not quickly forgotten.

                                                  Harry C.

p.s., Then there was that friend of mine who, for some long forgetten
      reason decided that he needed to measure the output voltage of
      a 15-KV, 40-Kw plate tranformer using a hand-held high-voltage
      probe on a meter.  (This is something that actually happened
      during the start-up days of the Princeton-Pennsylvania
      Accelerator back around 1964.)

      As he approached the tranformer's terminal with the probe, a
      corona discharge jumped to the well insulated probe in his hand,
      but still he dropped it.  It fell to the grounded case of the
      transformer, the discharge followed it, and the rest is history.
      (When they did a post-mortem on the transformer, although its
      windings were once rectangular to conform with the cross-section
      of its core, they were now perfectly round -- all three phases!)

                            GENERAL SCIENCE 12.

I am accident prone.  I will not deny this.  I will also not deny that I
love science.  Science has always been a logic course for me.  Yet when
logic, humans, and bad luck come together you get me.

I high school biology we had to dissect a once living mouse.  Well they had
injected the arteries with a type of red latex, and the veins with a blue
latex.  Well when you pull them out and tie them together you can get a
very reasonable rubber band.  The teacher couldn't figure out where all
these red and blue rubber bands were coming from.

In chemistry lab we always had quirt bottles full of di-water next to the
tables.  The person using the table next to mine and I always had a battle
with those bottles.  Well one day when I was doing an experiment he yelled
out my name and shot the liquid at me.  Well thank God it missed me since
the teacher replaced the di-water with sulfuric acid.  I noticed that the
liquid was smoking and bubbling before the other guy could get off a second
shot.

One of the experiments was to take lighters and long test tube, filled with
water submerged in water, and press the button on the lighter and let the
fluid change to gas and fill the long test tube.  Well I was the first done
with my experiment, and since the gas from the lighter is heavier than air
I could turn it up and the gas would still be in the tube.  Well the
teacher decided he wanted to show me a cool effect.  He lit a match and
dropped it into the tube.  Well as everyone knows heat expands the air, and
a lot of heat expands a lot of air.  I was picking glass out of my skin and
cloths for a week.  After the teacher told the rest of the students not to
do something like that two other people lit a match and dropped it into
their tubes.

In physics class we had a hand crank generator that we hooked up two wires
to.  We would see who would be stupid enough to hold onto the wires the
longest.  Well when it was my turn we put the BIG magnet on the generator,
and hand the red neck hick with a sadistic streak on him to turn the crank.
Well the shocks were greater than before, and then the hick decided to turn
the crank as fast has he could.  There was so much electricity that my
mussels locked up, and I couldn't let go.  I had to walk backwards to get
the wires out of my hands.

Still in high school we had a Van de Graph generator that, as an assistant,
I hooked up.  Well we got out the old plastic crate that was six inches off
the ground and I stood on it as another assistant turned on the generator.
Well even before I could get my hands to the globe there was such an
electrical charge that it traveled through me, through my shoes, and the
six inches of air to the ground.  This did not discourage us.  We shut off
the generator and I put my hands on the globe, and then turned it on.  I
don't remember much of what happened, but the other assistant said that
there were five or six discharges from the feet to the ground before having
to unplug the generator, the switch failed.

For some reason in chemistry class we had a massive amount of magnesium
ribbon.  Well one day we were going to do some experiment where we had to
scrape the corrosion off.  We were told to leave the dust from the sanding
on the table.  Well we didn't really notice the teacher go around and
collect the dust.  I did notice him go over to the "hot" Bunsen burner and
fire it up.  I wish I noticed him look away for he tossed the powder into
the flame.  The giant dark spot in my vision went away after about half an
hour.

I made it to college by some grace of God, and had my first physics lab.
Remember the test of gravity how you have the paper ribbon and a mass is
pulled down by gravity, and a sparker would leave repeated dark scorch
marks on the ribbon.  I don't know why by my group just had to have the
only time in the history of the lab where the sparker caught the ribbon on
fire.  Naturally there is never a convenient fire extinguisher around.  We
ended up blowing really hard and ended up blowing out the flaming paper.

I worked for the chemistry lab stock room for a little bit once.  Well I
was told to clean a pan that had some type of acid crystallized on the
side.  Well this acid could only be dissolved with ethanol.  Since ethanol
was a very prized in the stock room I was only permitted to use a small
amount.  Think hard on this one.  A lot of acid dissolved in little liquid
equals a high concentration.  That some how got on my skin.  When I felt
the pain I proceeded to douse my skin with ethanol.  When I told my boss he
didn't know which was worse, my wasting the ethanol or getting the acid on
my skin.

The latest and most painful was when I was working for the geology
department and we needed some liquid nitrogen.  Well I knew just where to
get some.  So taking a container with me, and going all by myself, since I
didn't want others to know about it, I went to the liquid nitrogen tank.  I
proceeded to fill the container.  I noticed the hose that I was using was
becoming covered in frost, but didn't think that hard on that fact.  I
proceed to turn off the valve.  I didn't notice that it too was covered in
frost.  Well when I made the last turn very tight I tried to take my hand
off the valve.  It was frozen to the valve.  Now understand this was in the
middle of July so it was about 100 degrees out, and here I was frozen.  I
lost multiple layers of skin that day.

Now understand these are just a few of the many situations that I have
gotten myself into.  Yes everyone of these are true.  Just be lucky I
didn't include when working in the chem stock room and I discovered the
well known (to everyone but me at that time) property of silver nitrate.
Thank God I am going into something safe like Geology where the worst that
I can do is kill only myself and who ever is at the bottom of a rock slide.

Somehow we found what the mixture that was used for espionage (taking
aerophotos during the night time) during the World War II was made of
(contact me for details :).  The basic idea is that it reacts quicly
releasing large ammount of bright light and in principle acts as huge
flash.  The mixture was simple, two-component mixture and through our
contacts and friends we did not have real problem to obtain the components.
We maid it in remote area of summer houses some 18 km from Riga city (the
capital of Latvia). Actually it was time before the New Year and we had
aslo other fireworks prepared, but this one was a kind of experiment and we
were looking forward to enjoy it wery much.  We made quite a big tight
paper package of this stuff thinking- the bigger the better, added home
made ignitor and burning cord, went out (it was night, aroung 11 p.m.,
though there was half moon and stars on the sky, so it was not completely
dark). We put the fire to the cord, left the paskage in the middle of the
road and stepped well back.  We were expecting some real explosion, light
sparks and stuff like this, of course.  The cord was burning, but it
somehow took a bit longer time than we were expecting. We all (like 4
people) were following closely the smoll flame on the cord with our sights
when......  ..... it just became all dark.  We did not hear any explosion,
except small "fuh!", we did not see ANY light.  The reaction was so quick
and so damn bright that we all got blinded for several tens of seconds. We
were blinking our eyes without seeing anything at all.  That is thing that
we still joke about with the friends when we met.

We realised that mixtures designed for special uses do not really fot for
pyrotechnics... :)

I have a quite mad very close best friend, well this friend switched to my
same school on my suggestion when he was "taken out" of his earlier school,
this school of mine was very very liberal (based on the sumerhill concept)
and we had grand teachers, so these teachers did not say "no" when my
friend choosen to do the work we all had to do for the two last years of
highschool about powder, my friend got in all kind of tests about powder
and finally produced what we decided to call "greenpeace powder" because I
said it was the powder that greenpeace would use to blow up contaminating
factories, this was because he decided to substitute the sulfur in the
normal mixing for some neat (expensively neat) amount of powdered
magnesium, wich produced an alkaline residue rather than an acid one, such
residue that acording to my friend's (doubtfull) calculations shoudl mix
with water producing Nitrogen wich should be good for the plants.... well
we we're on the lab by ourselves (with everything on hand of course)
testing that thing...  when he decides to do a "gas" test, wich means,
stuffing a well lot of that into a test tube, putting a lid on it and
putting the tube over the Bunsen.... yes I can imagine your faces
now.... well he does it, and we duck like we were chased by the devil, and
we wait and wait and wait and wait..... so nothing is happening, and my
friend got slightly impacient...... and yes he decides to rise from behind
our table to wich i started yelling "come back, come back" and certain so,
h was two steps away from the tube when the thing blew up.... my friend was
harmed but we tought he was, that because he was frozen like ice for
several minutes, barely breathing, the tube's cap flew up about 10 meters
and sqashed against the ceiling leaving an unremovable black spot in it,
the tube itself broke in two and the lower part flew back and landed on a
cloth on the table, this was a very think cloth that was folded in about
eight layers, and ven when the mixture hadn't burnt completely the tube
burnt thru the whole cloth like it as butter not even lighting it up....
(latter on open tubes with a electronic thermometer we tested this thign to
burn at near 630 celcius) and the whole lab was full of glass.......
needless to say we didn't ever ever try the experiene again (still our
teachers didn't stopped us from continuing on the experiment....).... I
wish I had a neat story to tell about the 200g of sodium he got hold of
next year but he just misplaced it and never foudn it again, someday his

 A quick and easy one...

Spit into a flask of liquid nitrogen. After a few seconds of bubbles and
sizzling your end product will be a nice little clear ball, similar to a
small hailstone, but very dry at that temperature. When you pull it out
with a pair of tongs you can handle the thing with your hands (badconductor
of heat). Then, pick your victims. Place these little marbles in their
pencil cases, on their lab books, drop them in their pockets, etc. They go
unnoticed while they are solid. Then wait.

   For my senior year in high school we had a physics teacher who was
really a French teacher at heart. He taught two other courses at the same
time (it was a small school). When it came down to the last five weeks of
school he was getting quite busy with marking in the other courses large
projects coming in and what not. With great faith in the senior class to be
mature.  Thought we were the one of the largest bunches of miscreants to
come through the school in many years. Chem. class had been disarmed by
many of our parents 20 years earlier and it's difficult to explain just how
literal that is (about 75% of us had at least one parent attend our school
most in a five year stint) Anyway the assignment was any project could be
done as long as it related to class in someway, this was busy work. idol
hands are the tool of the devil well so our busy ones. Enter weaponeering
101 as it was dubbed in a matter of days. One of the things covered was
trajectories. This gave birth to 3 catapults one required three people to
carry and had to be dismantled to be moved. One crossbow powered by leaf
springs that was almost a small ballista and a failed van de graph
generator that was more like a tesla coil. (a big ball that shoots off
electric arcs if you get to close) We had an arc starter from an old
furnace I was told it was about 12 000 volts it would jump about 3 inches
and lift you off the seat. This made for an entertaining close to a class
that had all ready cover such entertaining topics as: You actually
swallowed a AAA battery, What happens when you fill the lab with propane
(some dumbass junior tried that one) How hard is it to pry 4 crazy glued
text books apart and Does crazy glue bond sneaker rubber and floor tiles
(very well indeed).

Okay here is one, in 8th grade my idiot friend siad 5 years earlier he put
some play-doh into a bottle of tabasco sause, coem to find out that when
obsorbed by skin (or forced into the blood with a dart) would cause numbing
of the area, so another idiot friend of mine too a 2 liter boote of coke,
emptied it fillled half with the liquid, put a metal plate in it some
how. he filled the other half with water. Then came Homecoming football
(American Football) game, he "borrowed" some dry ice and put it in the
water helf, he used just enough (guess we wasnt that dumb if he measured
it) and threw the numbomb as we called it over the football field, it
exploded numbing the arms of both football teams, and completely numbing
the cheer leaders, it was funny, though people thought it was gun fire from
the sound of the bottle exploding and when the foot ball player and Cheer
leaders collapsed from the sheer numbness and shock the whole area screamed
and we ran off.

 Another small explosion We had just moved into a brand new lab & the board
of directors were coming on an inspection visit.  To impress them we
started a series of ether extractions in the new fume cupboard.  Naturally
the lab soon filled with ether fumes but chemists get off on such things so
no one commented.

The chairman of the board led his party into the room & to our horror he
was smoking a huge cigar.  A most beautiful phenomena then occurred.  A
small ball of flame moved in slow motion from the cigar towards the fume
cupboard, however none of the lab staff saw it arrive as we were all
cowering behind benches before it got half way there.  The resulting
explosion destroyed the first soxhlet apparatus, moved on to the next &
then the next in a chain reaction this shattered the fume cupboard &
damaged the entire end of the lab.

Such fun, very dignified elderly men & women under chairs, lying in the
hallway & in heaps on top of each other.  Try it sometime. I guarantee that
you will get unlimited funding for at least three years.

I'm going into engineering, so during my four years of high school, I felt
it very important to take as many science classes as possible, so from all
those classes, I have a lot of memorable moments.
One of the ones that stands out the most was in my Biotechnology class, my
sophmore year.  It was mostly a lab class dealing with growing bacteria and
had to use proper sterilization techniques.  I can't remember the name of
any of those techniques, but they involved passing the inoculating loop
over the flame of a bunsen burner, then scraping some bacteria up with it
and putting the bacteria on a petri dish.  Two interesting occurrences
happened in this process.
One one particular lab, we were growing 3 different kinds of bacteria on
one plate, so we divided the plates into fourths and used the extra
quadrant for a control.  One of my friends got the inocculation process
wrong and sterilized the loop after he had scooped some of the bacteria
onto it.  So, of the four quadrants, the only one that grew any bacteria
was the one one that wasn't supposed to (the control).  The other result of
this little project is that he contaminated all the test tubes of bacteria
that everyone else was using, so everyone else's experiements got messed up
too.
The other interesting experiment in that class was when we were supposed to
be growing bacteria again.  Of course, this was toward the end of the
school year and growing bacteria had gotten a little boring, so we were
playing with other lab tools.  We stained eachother with all of the stains
that make cells visible under a microscope and basically never go away.
Handily enough, these came in nice little squirt bottles that made it
obvious that they were made for this purpose.  During this lab, we also
found that the tongs in the lab were made of copper.  From this we learned
that, when burnt, copper gives off a brilliant green flame.  Also learned
that teachers WILL expel students, even near the end of the school year.
 
My favorite class was Mr. Squire's chemistry class.  He was noted for hard
tests and homework, but that was just the kind of class I liked.  We did a
few labs, but he always made sure we used proper safety precautions.
The most memorable moment in high school was when we did our thermite
experiment.  We took a clay flower pop, filled it up with the thermite
mixture and lit it with a sparkler so that it would drip out the hole in
the bottom into a box of sand.  We did this outside in the parking lot, as
he had previously had troubles with it inside and the experiment was banned
from being done indoors.  So, we did the experiment in the parking lot and
the thermite melted right through the sand, the box, and the parking lot.
Later that year, we were doing a lab with an extremely weak solution of
Hydrochloric Acid (<<1M).  My lab partner was afraid to work with any
concentration, so I had to do the lab work and she wrote the results.  We
had a test-tube full of HCl, and a rubber stopper with a peice of magnesium
ribbon attatched to it that we were supposed to shove into the test tube to
watch the production of hydrogen gas.  When I jammed the stopper into the
test tube, it sprayed the acid solution all over the room.  I couldn't help
but laugh, even though i was soaked with the acid.  The teacher and a
couple of other students couldn't stop laughing  Everyone else freaked out.
My lab partner got a few drops on her and kinda freaked, but wasn't nearly
as afraid the next experiment.  For some reason, she didn't want me to work
with acid anymore.  Go figure!  The best thing that happened from this
experiment is that my lab partn! er still remembers me, even though she
hasn't seen me since we got out of that class.  Whenever I see her mom, she
asks "Hey, weren't you Renee's chemistry partner?  She still asks about you
a lot."  So, I guess there was chemistry between us.  Okay, bad pun. 
 
The next year, Mr. Squire retired, so I had Mr. Long for my Advanced
Chemistry and Physics classes.  Lots of interesting experiences in those
classes. 
In physics, we were doing an experiment with little matchbox cars and a
track and ramp.  I don't know how that related to physics at all, but my
group decided to make it more interesting, so between the take off and
landing ramps, we decided to make the car go through a ring of fire.  But,
we couldn't figure out how to do that, so we just set up a bunsen burner
and decided that was good enough.  Then we got caught and sent to the
office. 
We also took a van de graph generator (one of those things that generates
static electricity) and wired it to the doorknob so that when the Mr. Long
came in, he would get a nice little shock.  However, he was in the
chemistry closet watching us and made the kid who set it up touch it after
it had charged up for several minutes.  Another time, we stole the van de
graph and did that to another teacher.  Mr. Long is the one who got in
trouble for it though and it started a feud between the math teachers and
the science teachers that lasted the rest of the year. 
One of my classmates was always filling pop bottles with the gas for the
bunsen burners and squeezing it in people's faces to watch their reaction
to the nauxious smelling gas.  One day, I remembered I had a lighter in my
pocket, so when he squeezed it in my face, I dared him to do it again, and
when he did, BOOM!!!!  Actually, no explosion, just a quick flash of flame.
I was disappointed, but it was more effective to get him to quit doing that
to people than the 100 times Mr. Long threatened to kick him out of class. 
In our advanced chem. class, one of the students was incredibly afraid of
acids, so we labled a bottle "6M HCl" and filled it up with water before he
got to class one day.  When he got there, we proceeded to play catch with
it and managed to spill some on his books.  He freaked out...but not as
much as when we poured it into test tubes and took shots of it. 
Another day in advanced chem, we took his old computer and wrote a program
that went had a loop that asked you "who is the pimp master?" and when you
answered, it displayed "dylan scott (another student in my class) is the
biggest pimp in the world"  Of course, we couldn't remember how to exit a
loop, so it just displayed that over and over until you turned the computer
off.  Mr. Long was pretty mad about that. 
Another day, we had bunsen burners out and were bored with our lab, so
someone grabbed a handful of magnesium powder and threw it on the burner.
That was pretty cool, so we did it again, only this time his hand was
sweaty and some of the powder stuck to it and burnt him. 
We also did a few demonstrations, including a grape cannon (similar to a
potato gun, only smaller) which we shot at targets outside (targets
included the gym teacher and several p.e. students who were walking the
track).  We made an acetylene cannon that shot foam Nerf balls so we could
shoot inside and really loaded it up with the ingredients for acetylene
(calcium carbide and water), waited a minute for it to make enough gas, and
lit it.  The ball went through the cieling in one place and there's a black
spot where the flame shot out of the barrel. 
The next year, our school had a NEW chemistry teacher again.

My class was well-behaved, but a bunch of pyromaniacs. We had 3 science
teachers retire and two others re-write their curricula to take fire/open
flame out of as many labs as possible.

1) Pick a number between 1 and 9

2) Subtract 5

3) Multiply by 3 

4) Square the number 

5) Add the digits of that number together, for example, if you number is
83, you would add 8 and 3 and get 11.

6) If the resulting number is less than 5, add five, otherwise subtract 4

7) Multiply by 2 

8) Subtract 6 

9) Assign a letter to your number.  A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4, E=5, etc 

10) Pick a country that begins with your letter 

11) Pick an animal that begins with the second letter from your country 

12) think of the color of that animal....



















If you did this right and didn't pick something off the wall for the animal
or country, you should come up with...

A grey elephant from Denmark.


(The trick is in step5.  3) and 4) caused the number to be a multiple of 9
and the sum of the numbers of a multiple of 9 is again a multiple of 9, in
this case 0 or 9.  Step 6 equals these situations and if you do not think
of the Dominician Republic you get Denmark for number 4.  The elephant is
the easiest animal with 'e'.)

Tell someone to write down a 3 digit number (example: 746) Tell them that
you are each going to write down 2 more 3 digit numbers and add them, but
before you do, you are going to write down the answer on a piece of paper
and fold it up.  You obtain the answer by subtracting 2 from the last digit
of the first number and placing a 2 before the first digit--thus 746
becomes 2744 for the answer.  Now ask the other person to put their two
digits down, either both at once or in succession with you.  Either way,
they must preceed you.  Now , whatever they put down, make each number,
when added to the number you put down add up to 999.  Don't do this but
once with each person; they'll catch on otherwise.

Demo: (original number) 746 (Their first number) 325 (your first number)
674 (their second number) 841 (Your second number) 158
                                       ____ Total 2744

They unfold the paper and you're a hero!

From: dleqc@qcunix1.acc.qc.edu Here's another math trick involving "casting
out the nines":

Tell someone to do the following:

(1) Write down a three-digit number (where the digits are different), and
    keep it hidden from you.  (2) Reverse the digits and write that number
down.  (3) Subtract the smaller number from the larger number.  (4) Find
the same page in the phone book as the answer in (3) and remember
    the first and last names of whoever is listed at the top of the first
    column there.  (5) Close the phone book.  (5) Tell you just the *first*
letter of the last name.

   You then open the phone book to the page containing that name and
announce the full name of the person.

Here's how it's done:

   Whatever number the person selects in (1), the answer in (3) will
contain a 9 in the middle and the first and third numbers will add up to 9.

   If, for example, the person writes down 623, this number reversed will
be 326. When 326 is subtracted from 623, the result is 297. Note that the
middle digit of this answer is 9 and that the sum of the first and last
digits is 9.

   Whatever letter the person gives you as the beginning of the last name,
there will be only be *one* page number in the book (unless you live in an
extremely populous city!) where the names begin with that letter, have a 9
in the middle and the first and third digits add up to 9. Find that page
and read off the first name on it to the amazement of your victim.

Confuse people with the following riddle: Three friends go to sleep in a
hotel.  The man at the desk ask $30 for the room. (This is old...). After
they pay $10 each and they went to their rooms, the manager comes in and
tells the receptionist that that was the price for the expensive rooms.
The cheap rooms the friends toke only cost $25 , so give them $5 back.  The
receptionist thinks it is difficult to divide $5 among three people, they
would be happy to get something back and would not begrudge him some money
for his trouble, gives the customers $1 each and keeps $2 for himself.

So the friends pay 3*9 is $27 for the room and the receptionist gets $2,
together $29.  Where has the last $1 gone?

Here is a nice way to introduce identities to a beginning algebra class...

Ask the class to chose any number, but to keep it a secret.

Add and subtract some numbers, eg. add 37 to the number, subract 86, then
add 3.

Now subtract the result from the original secret number.

No matter the secret number, everyone finishes with the same number - in my
example, 46.

As a trick to amuse the class, write the final number (in my example, 46)
on the back of your hand in soap before class.  After the class finishes
with the manipulations, ask one of the students to crumple the paper and
give it to you.  Burn it, then rub the ash on the back of your hand and the
number written in soap will become visible.

The explaination goes something like this.  The secret number we will call
n.

n + 37 - 86 + 3 = n - 46 subracting the result (n - 46) from the origninal
secret number n, n - (n - 46) = 46 is an identity (the result is not
dependent upon the number n).

A friend of mine got a hold of a large chunck of potassium metal which he
brought to a party. He managed to dare another guy to make it explode. The
other guy wasn't of the brightest type, and he didn't believe it would
explode in contact with water. Anyhow, stupid as he was, he went to the
bathroom and thew it into the toilet. Nothing happened, so he went back out
again, saying to my friend "Hey, nothing happe...." BANG!!!!!!!!!!!!! The
whole bathroom was covered with smoke, and the toilet-seat was completely
ruined, cracked and everything.  The guy who held the party had to use the
neighbors bathroom the following week, until his own one got repaired.

My High School science courses were similarly interesting.

We had a Science 10 teacher who wasn't usually much for science. As a
demonstration, he dropped a blob of sodium into a pan of water. Very
impressive. Especially when, with a "pop" the sodium exploded in front of
the teacher. He did the demo for the next block with a much smaller piece
of sodium...

Another good one was our Chem 12 teacher, who left some disgusting, viscous
black mixture on his lab table at the front of the class. We were all busy
at our desks, when all of a sudden there was a huge, loud "POP!" and the
sucker exploded! Blew black goo up to the ceiling, over the front desks,
down to the floor. The stuff on the ceiling never did come off, and some of
the students would no longer sit in the front row.

   My Yr 12 chemistry teacher (young guy, had only been teaching for about
three or four years) told us about the time when he was at College doing
his dip ed, and he was working with sodium. He was pouring the kerosine off
the oil and down the sink, and there was one chip of sodium left at the
bottom of the tin he was emptying (unfortunately for him). Well, it fell
out, and because someone had been using the sink before him there was water
in there. The sodium ignited, flared and set the kerosine on fire which
then raced along the length of the sink and down the plughole with one
almighty explosion.
   He said he had to have a haircut that night because he lost his fringe
and both his eyebrows.

 Yet another exploding light metal story....

A friend of mine was recently doing a PhD in Chemistry in the building next
door to where I am writing this... anyway, his project seemed to involve
increasingly more dangerous chemicals for no good reason.
  Normally, you sign out all chemicals, and they're all accounted for at
the end of the day. But, towards the end of his PhD, he opened one of his
cupboards to discover a jar of Sodium that he'd got, never used, and the
paperwork (it turned out) for it had since been lost.

        This was *2 Kg* of sodium in a big lump.

Sodiums not very dense, that's a big f**ker.
   Anyhow, the fate of this lost lump was to accompany some of the students
out to a lake in the park, where they threw it...still in its jar (that
they managed to get this far at all is kinda surprising because they were
all completely blootered at the time).
   And then, in a masterpiece of forward planning, they got out the airgun
:o) ... 'cos they were all drunk, and the jar (now floating on the lake)
was fairly thick, it took quite a few shots to break.
   Surprisingly, the thing didn't explode...it just sat there burning.
(obviously only the surface of the lump was reacting, but even so...) So
they all sat down, cracked open some more beers, and watched the sodium
light up the night. Cool.

 This isn't my E-mail account and my real name may or may not be "Andy".

The title I have given this E-mail is "Pranks...Science
related.....Sex...Fettish...mice", It is to do with science and Pranks, but
I did the others just to disappoint the perverts among us.

Or maybe I didn't.

Anyway, when I was 15, and at a selective intake school, I came across this
rather amazing reaction. Not by chance either, I'd heard of people being
maimed by it, so I naturally decided to try it myself. And I wasn't alone,
there were about 10 or 12 of us.

Ofcourse Teenage Boys don't just want to do as well as each other, they
really want to be the best, but this is where the fun started.

The Reaction was that between Magnesium and Potassium Permanganate, two
rather reactive substances. We all know that if you put "Just a little"
Magnesium Powder in a Bunsen Burner it burns with a blinding white light.
Which is why everyone's Chemistry Department kept it "out of harm's way".

Well basically, they messed up by informing us that our pencil sharpeners
were made from a duplex structure of Aluminium and Magnesium. Good move.
That ment that our class then had easy access to as many blocks of
Magnesium/Aluminium alloy as we cared for. Converting it to powder only
took a file and a clamp, and hence we were ready. For what? we didn't know,
and we didn't care. Just so long as it made a loud Bang and was painful to
look at.

Experiments got bigger and bigger, until the highlight of our pyro career
when we decided to wake up about 150 people over a widespread area.

The filing took weeks. The construction hours, the planning days, but at
last it was ready. The world's First, Last, and hence Best "G.B.M.F."

The Name was simple to make up- we just took the first letters of each word
in the first apt description. ("Wow!" I said when I first saw it, "That
really is THE Great British Mother F*&^er!").

The night came when we were going to detonate the GBMF, it was dark, we had
an appointment, and it was a nice sleepy Wednesday night. Every where was
calm and tranquill. Enter three Cretins cluching bag filled with home made
explosives. We intended to light it using a rather pathetic piece of
Magnesium Ribbon, which, in turn, would be lit by my own Blow torch.

We had found a nice little spot in a metre wide alley in a residential
area.  There were lots of alleys near by, which we knew from our after
school smoking sessions. These would provide quick get-a-way if
required. Our spot to stand was a nice sheltered spot in an alley offset by
about five metres on the opposite side of the road.

 If there was one thing we had learned from past experiences it was that
two things could go wrong with our Bangers- the Fuses and the Casing. We
had chosen the best fuse so far for this- Magnesium, and our casing was
made out of Plastic lids and Sellotape. More Sellotape than plastic lids,
though.

We laid the GBMF down carefully and placed a small Union Jack by it.
Cautiously we lit the Blow torch and set off the Magnesium Ribbon. And ran
like buggery. We got to our viewing point and braced ourselves.

Five seconds passed, nothing.

Ten seconds passed, nothing.

By twenty seconds we had got bored of bracing and urged "Bob" to go and
look.

Bob sneaked out of our safe haven and leaned over to look down the Alley.
After one glance he saw that it hadn't gone out as expected, something far
worse. He sighed and made the disapointed report to me and "Paul" that:

"It's shit, The casing has caught fire I don't think it's going to G...".
Bang would be an understatement. BANG would be an understatement.

Is a bit more like it. "Bob" Shat one. He Legged it like a bat out of hell
all the way down our Alley way, with me and "Paul" close behind. What I had
heard and seen was phenominal. That flash would have been bright during the
day, but on a night like this........

As we reached the end of our alley the others wanted to keep running, but I
slowed us all down to a brisk stroll as we entered the main road. As we
walked past the road with the alleys in, a good ten seconds had elapsed
since our brief sprint, the whole of the road was out of their houses,
peering cautiously down the alley.

On the way back from our appointment, we visited the Alley. On the ground
there was scorch marks (which are still there today) that reached a radius
of 7 metres, with a little unburnt patch in the middle, showing the
circular birthmark of the first, the last and the best GBMF in history.

We did what we aimed to achieve, We caused a commotion, we beat our rivals,
and we made our mark (literally) in local folk lore. The Alley is now known
amongst the younger members of our community as "The GBMF Alley", and the
tale of our achievement is recited to all newcommers to the pyro world
along side the all-time classics like "Paul"'s Brother's friend's Cousin
who shot a Pool Ball through his friend's Frontdoor (and stairs) from
across the road.

This wasn't strictly a practical joke but it must have been a great
sight... and it couldn't be done (legally) today.

My old chemistry prof got an increase in his materials budget (that's how
you know how long ago this happened) and decided to replace the materials
in his locker.  Most of them he was able to dispose of according to
standard protocols, but... he had a great big lump of sodium metal (he
estimated later about 400g) sitting in light oil in a paint can.  Oh
bother, he said, what am I going to do with this.

He put it in the trunk of his car and drove to the lake where his outboard
was docked, put the sodium carefully in the boat, and grumbled out to
mid-lake....unlocked the top of the can....lowered it over the side and
TOOK OFF.

About thirty seconds later he cut the motor and looked back.  Straight out
of the middle of the lake rose a ten-foot conical violet flame....

From: Paul Intihar <pintiha@gwgate1.jhmi.jhu.edu> Must have been a lump of
metalic potassium; sodium erupts in a yellow flame, vis-a-vis the glow of a
sodium vapor lamp. Now that the statute of limitations has run out, I can
admit to having done the sodium trick and got a nice yellow
explosion. Potassium explodes on contact with water also, and, as I recall,
gives a purple tinge in the Bunsen burner flame test.

 I remember my 10th grade highschool chem 1 class.  I was a prety
intelligent person at the time, for my age.  One day we decided to play a
prank on the class, scared the shit out of the whole bunch of them.  Took
some potassium, a beaker, a very large baloon, and a lighter.  Stuck some
water, and potassium in the baker, and placed the baloon over it.. We all
know that will produce hydrogen, so we let the baloon off the beaker,
closed it off, and let it be passed around the room for a while.  The
teacher started to get curious about what we were doing (he couldn't see us
doing this).  We finally decided to light it up, right in the middle of a
small chapter test.  Letting the baloon go, someone stuck it with one of
those grill lighters.  The baloon exploded into a large ball of fire, and
an interesting noise followed.  The smartass who lit it up had no hair on
his arms anymore, and we had no grade in chem 1.  ohwell.

When we were at last grades of the secondary school (i.e.- highschool), we
developed quite sophisticated theory how to stop the school operate for at
least several days.  Idea was simple like that: 1) we had to obtain a piece
of potassium large enought to obtain REAL rffect, 2) this piece of
potassium, then would be wrapped in newspaper paper good enough not to let
water to reach it immediately, 3) after wrapping it should be thrown into a
closet and flushed down so it would go down the pipes

The idea was that after some time water will reach the potassium, it would
start to react releasing heat and hydrogen and blow up the pipes flooding
the school with sewage water.

The idea was never implemented. :)

                    I BLEW UP MY VERY FIRST EXPERIMENT

I have the dubious distinction of having been the only one I know to have
blown-up my very first chemistry experiment.  Basically it was done not so
much to acquire knowledge as to familiarize us with the equipment.  The
idea was to put some materials on a flat piece of steel, place it on a ring
above a bunsen burner, and heat it.  As I recall we had a strip of
magnesium, some sugar, a piece of iron, some sulfur and a few other odds &
ends.  The sulfur was the only thing that did anything interesting (so
far).  It's important to note the arrangement of the counters on which we
worked.  The tops had a sink off to one end and there were two gas valves
for the burners, one on each side of the sink's faucet with the outlets
pointing toward the sink.

Anyway, once I had successfully made the collection of stuff on the steel
plate red hot and noted the results on paper it was time to clean up.
Unfortunately in the process of shutting down the heat I had pulled the
hose off the gas valve shortly before turning it off.  The gas collected in
the sink.  When the hot metal met the gas: WHOOMP!  Credible observers tell
me I was standing there momentarily enveloped by a bright blue ball
 that stretched from the sink to the ceiling.  I lost most of my eyebrows,
the hair on my arms, but got a fairly good haircut once I'd shampooed the
odor out.

Not quite a prank, but dang funny:

While I was in a high school chem class, the teacher was showing how to
properly heat a test tube with a Bunsen burner.  He said "never point the
mouth of the tube toward you like this (pointing tube at his head)" Always
point the test tube away from your body (turns test tube away).  At that
instant, the alcohol/acid solution in the tube shot out and ignited,
flaming a 5 foot periodic table on the wall.  Half of class broke out
laughing while other half was frozen in seats.  Teacher grabs fire bottle
and puts out fire.  Teacher never gave that demo in the same way again!

My science teacher gave a demonstration on electric current by makeing
circits in beakers of salt water.  Then he dropped it so that half of it
was in a beaker and the other half was out.  Theoreticaly he should have
been able to pick it up with no problem because it was not completeing a
circut.  would have been safe, except he was leaning against the metal
plumbing.  He almost put a dent in the chalk board.

Later in the year he used the gas lines in the class rooms to blow bubbles
and them ignite them with a match.  There is still a scorch mark uon the

While I was a junior in high school, I took chemistry under our department
chairman, Peter Quackenbush McKee. Mr. McKee was sharp, except for a
tendency to do experiments that get out of hand. His most notable exploit
(?) occurred during a demonstration of the thermite reaction.  This was
done in a ceramic "cup" which sat in a sandbox on a lab bench covered with
asbestos paper. In order to give a better idea of how hot it gets,
Mr. McKee put a couple of nails and a couple of brass screws in the bottom
of the cup before filling it with thermite. Well, actually he filled the
cup about half-way with thermite, paused, then said "Well, let's go all the
way" or words to that effect, THEN filled the cup. This immediately got our
attention, since we had seen him in action before. He then put a little
starter mixture on the top, and stuck a magnesium strip into it. In order
that we might see the proceedings more clearly, he turned out the
lights. As he was lighting the magnesium strip, he advised us, "This may
spit a little, so why don't the guys in the front row move back a little?"

This was enough to cause the entire class to move to the back wall. He
shrugged, then lit the strip.

The magnesium strip burned brightly until it reached the starter mixture,
which sputtered a little, then the thermite caught. It did indeed spit a
little, but as soon as the reaction zone moved below the surface it all
became rather tame. After, say, 15 or 20 seconds, he remarked that we had
gotten excited for nothing.

Then the reaction zone reached the bottom of the cup.

Now, thermite is hot enough that the byproducts are molten aluminum oxide
floating in molten iron. This does nothing to iron nails, but it is hot
enough to vaporize brass.

In the darkened classrom, it looked for all the world like a Bessemer
converter firing off in a steel mill. Blobs of molten iron were scattered
across the floor like incandescent blobs of mercury as everyone tried
simultaneously to levitate. Smoke rose from the benchtop, where puddles of
iron had eaten through the asbestos paper, and from the baseboards where
they had caught fire. It was all very impressive and no one was hurt. What
more can one ask from a science experiment?

 Liquid nitrogen can be a fun thing.  In my freshman chem class at a large
university, the prof was fond of demos.  In a class of 300 people,
something is needed to keep them awake.  So one day, he has several liters
of liquid nitrogen, which he was using for his demos.  He did the usual --
freeze a rubber ball and then shatter it, shrink a balloon, etc.  When he
was finished, he had quite a bit left, but decided to do something with it
rather than just return it to the storeroom.  Since liquid nitrogen in an
open container will produce a nice fog, he said to the class, "I'll just
pour it in the sink here."  He did, and continued lecturing.  About half a
minute later, there was a nice POP! when the cast iron sink cracked in
front of 300 witnesses.

My father graduated in Chemical Engineering just after the war. About this
time, some of the first polymers were being produced, specifically urea
formaldehyde. My father's class were told to evaluate and "cost" the
process. Naturally he began with a rough-and-ready demonstration of the
reaction.

The constituents are, of course, urea and formalin. Sulphuric acid is used
as a catalyst to start the reaction. The word of caution is that one must
add the sulphuric acid FIRST, then pour the reagents in a few drops at a
time. Not my Dad. Into a flask went a pound or so of urea, several pints of
formalin and finally the acid.

The revolting mixture shuddered, heaved and made several disgusting
noises. My Dad and his fellow students first gathered round and looked
interested, then hastily backed away. Finally, the mixture erupted, the
narrow neck of the flask allowing the "ejecta" to accelerate to quite a
speed. It hit the ceiling and splattered over nearby desks and
equipment. There it set, very rapidly and very hard.

                      COLD FUSION
From: Chris Murray 

 Hello group,

I've lurked in and out of this group occasionally over the last 6 months or
so, but I just remembered a story that might make some of you chuckle.

When I was studying Materials Science in Trinity College Dublin years ago,
the whole cold fusion thing erupted. Of course the media went mad over the
whole thing and public interest was huge. Out of public demand, and no
doubt spotting an opportunity for some free publicity, the Physics
Department decided to give a public lecture on the science behind cold
fusion.

The day came and the crowd was much bigger than I thought it would be,
maybe about 300-400 people - students and other lecturers and I suppose
people from the press.  They filled the physics large lecture theatre and I
believe the technicians even rigged up a TV connection to the smaller
theatre downstairs. I was late for the lecture (as usual) and the only
remaining seat in the large theatre was right in the middle of the front
row.

Prof. Mike Coey was giving the talk, an old hand in magnetism and
superconductivity. He had even set up a little experiment on the desk in
front of him, consisting of a few beakers, bits of metal, wires and a
couple of thermometers. He explained that he had loaded some Pd with
hydrogen and would now look for the reaction. He said that if the reaction
worked, one could expect to see a temperature rise in the fusion cell over
the control cell. There were little lead bricks surrounding the experiment,
presumably to stop any radiation which might escape. The was a little
unnerving as my seat meant that I was sitting about 5 feet from the thing!

Anyway, he started the experiment and proceeded to give the main part of
the talk. Interesting stuff, specially the bit about the original
discoverers' experimental meltdown! The came the big moment - did the
desktop experiment work!?

The crowd went expectantly quiet. Mike was having a little difficulty
reading the exact temperatures from the thermometers and had to stick his
head right into the guts of the experiment to have a good look.
Unfortunately I decided that this would be a good time to take a photo.  I
grabbed my ancient Zenith camera, switched on the flash and ......POP!
Poor Mike must have had a bit of a fright when all of a sudden there was a
blinding flash of light! It must have seemed like the whole bloody thing
had gone off! The crowd were pretty amused, although I don't think Mike was
too impressed.

Funny thing was that the experiment had actually produced a positive
result! The temperature was higher in the fusion cell!

Pity the bloody photograph wasn't in focus!

When I was In year 7 (thats 11-12 yr olds) we had a trainee teacher for
science for a while. It was the lesson of term so he decided to 'show off'
a bit. He was going to show us the H2O + K -> H2 + KO2 (I think thats
right) experiment, so he had a large water bath on his desk with perespex
screens surrounding it. He started small with lithium and the class gasped
as the lithium fizzed a bit and then dissapeared. He then used sodium the
sodium whizzed around the bowl, caught fire and gradually, it all reacted
with water and was gone with a small 'pop'. He then moved to pottasium. For
this demonstration he made the people in the front row wear goggles. He had
trouble cutting the pottasium and broke several stanley-knives attempting
to do so. Eventually he gave up and dumped the large chunk in the bowl. The
class watched as the potassium spontaneously caught fire, whizzed around
the water bath and then exploded. It would have been fine had it not been
such a large chunk of potassium. Pieces of pottasium shot up into the air
and melted holes in the ceiling which are there to this day. One piece of
potassium shot over the screen and burnt a clean hole in the fleece of one
of the people in the front row at the base of their zip.
 
And the moral of that story is *never* *ever*, under *any* circumstances
sit in the front row of a science lesson. :-)

 I have not always been a geologist.  No, I am still a physicist, and am
learning to be a geologist.  There is just two small problems with this.
One I hate being out doors, and two I am accident prone.  Perhaps this is
not the best combination for a geologist, but I make it work.  I have had
to make it work for past experiences have forced me to make them work.
Perhaps a few examples would help.

I learned that field work is not for me.  This was painfully obvious when I
was taking glacial geology and not nice things happened to me.  Okay in
Ohio we have very nice glacial deposits.  Now we can usually only see, up
close, the deposits when a small stream or river has cut out a section and
exposed the glacial deposits.  Well on one of those trips with the class I
found the one spot in the stream, that we had to cross, where there was a
three foot hole.  I am only five feet eight, and the water was up about two
feet.  You do the math!

It was also on glacial field trips that I found I have bad luck with
falling rocks.  There were trees growing on top of these out crops of
glacial material, and well a stiff wind can blow these things over.  One
incident of this I had a choice.  I could have a hundred and fifty pound
tree land on me like a pile driver, or dive into the river.  I came home
wet that day, but without a cracked skull.

One field trip with my mineralogy class we went to a quarry and scavenged
the large boulders before they were crushed up into gravel.  Okay these
were huge boulders.  I was standing on one the size of a bus and planned on
jumping over a deep space between the boulders and land on another bolder
and swing my legs over the top.  That didn't happen.  Okay first I had to
jump onto a lower bolder and then I would jump onto the bolder I planned on
swinging my legs over.  When I jumped onto the lower bolder my momentum
carried me face first into the bolder I planned on swinging over.  Well I
was wearing a garment that had pockets on the front, and in those pockets I
had the minerals that I intended to keep.  Well I hit a mostly flat bolder
and those minerals were jammed into my abdomen.  I say mostly since there
was a part of the bolder jutting out right where my right leg came into
contact (I still have the scar).  Well when I hit the bolder I hung on for
my life.  You see I was hanging over the deep pit between the boulders, and
if I fell I would be even more hurt.  So pulling myself up by my finger
tips I made it to the top of a different bolder.  When one of my class
mates asked if I was okay my response was, "let me check.  No."

My latest excursion out of the lab was on a paleontology trip to collect
fossils.  We went to a road cut just outside of Cincinnati where the road
cut was gigantic thirty to twenty foot high steps in shale and limestone.
The way we could get to the next step was to climb up the area where the
rain had washed down the step.  Well I was climbing one (in hopes of
finding a trilobite) and going slow.  I was carrying my rock hammer and
collection bag with me and when I had my head just peeking over the top of
the next step I placed the bag and hammer on the step and started to pull
myself up.  That was when the shale decided it didn't like me anymore.  If
you have ever played with shale you know it crumbles under any pressure,
and that is what it did to me.  I felt like I was on a three stooges show
because as me shirt was ripped apart so did my skin begin to do so.  When I
stopped at the bottom of the step a quick inspection just meant that I
needed Band-Aids, and I had to climb up and get my rock hammer.

On that same trip we were on the other side of the road just getting to the
level we needed.  Okay I was trying to get to the step and my boot got
caught under one rock and my body still went forward.  Well to get both
feet under me I sort of jumped, not the smartest thing I had ever done.  I
went forward head first.  I have always said that being short is not so
bad, now I think that it is a God send.  If I was the six foot tall man
that all the women find attractive I would be dead.  When I landed I landed
on my knees and hands.  My fingers were curling over the edge of the step.
My head stuck over the side and I was looking at the thirty feet down to
the next step, and the seventy feet down to the road.  I was told that the
professor fell silent and was in shock when he saw me almost go over the
edge.  My line after that was, "Guess who still has a heart beat?"

These are just some of the experiences that lead me to believe that when I
become a graduate student I will not even make it to my doctoral thesis.  I
will die so quick that I might not even get to see a winter.  So this is my
testament to people that says, "I warned you."

 NAME: Strange matter
 DESCRIPTION: Cartoons
on science subjects.  The website also contains some pseudo-scientific
articles by Nick D. Kim.  The name Strange Matter was first applied to
these cartoons after it was determined that when viewed, they are capable
of inducing observable distortions in the local sections of the Universe.
Such macroscopic perturbations to quantum reality are indeed an unusual
outcome to the act of cartoon observation, so it seemed appropriate the
name them in honour of one of the strangest substances known to theoretical
physics, Strange Matter. After ingestion, they should be washed down with a
shot of whisky.

NAME: Improved Methods for Transportation of Hunted Animals
ABSTRACT:
Modern hunting tools like spears and clubs provide a dramatic increase of
hunting efficiency. For even small tribes slaying fairly large beasts, like
mammuts, becomes possible. Since carrying home mammuts is one of the major
problems in modern hunting, we propose a new tool, called wheel, that
provides efficient transportation of mammuts.

 NAME: Humor on Control Systems

DESCRIPTION: Mathematical Cartoons, not just control systems. Below follows
the official description:

'Control' is being said an "experimental subject" (see, for example,
D. S. Bernstein, "Control Experienments and What I learned From Them: A
Personal Journey", IEEE Control Systems, vol. 18, no. 2, pp. 81-88)
although only the applied mathematics motivated papers can be published in
top international journals. Therefore, humor accurs. Here is a collection
of control-related humors published in the IEEE Control Systems Magzine
from 1984-1994 under the column of "Out of Control". Unfortunately, this
column is seemingly a disturbance (periodical or, repetitive:) and thus was
rejected by Control Systems since 1995. I enjoyed those humors and I
believe that humor implies creativity.

in strange positions which seem impossible? It is almost as if the
classical laws of mechanics no longer apply in the game. It may be that
croquet is the visible manifestation of the quantum world.

 NAME: THE WORM RUNNER' DIGEST

DESCRIPTION: Back in the 1960s the JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY was a
double magazine.  The flip side was a scientific humor magazine named THE
WORM RUNNER'S DIGEST, because the chief perpetrators were working on
learning in planaria...

The JBP part published stuff about planaria (flatworm) experiments. Some of
those were really funny. The WRD part published all kinds of funny
'science' articles, not just those about worms. I seem to recall one about
the breeding of giant chickens for use by the military. There was a
photograph of giant chickens serving as crew on a real army tank. I guess
you had to see it.

You might have to try a few (science) libraries until you find it.

 I also agree with the didactic effectiveness of ecological humor.  A very
good source for quipster material as a teaching tool in ecology is soon to
be published by Gordon & Brich in Longhorn PA, from many of Dr. Eugene
Odum's ecological vignettes.  It includes cartoons, which is even better
for the grafic appeal and the quality of the cartoonists.  Good luck.

From: Christian Jost <Christian.Jost@EPC.U-PSUD.FR> NAME: The snouters,
form and life of the rhinogrades

DESCRIPTION: Besides Dr Seuss, there is also a nice little booklet by
Harald Stuempke: "Bau und Leben der Rhinogradentia", or, in its english
version edited by the university of Chicago press, "The snouters, form and
life of the rhinogrades". Its about the mythical fauna in a small pacific
island with noses evolved to serve all special purposes (jumping, diving,
walking etc.). The complete biology, systematics and ecology of the group
are developped and illustrated, the whole presented like a real scientific
paper, with references, footnotes to disputes over certain classification
details etc. I much enjoyed reading it.

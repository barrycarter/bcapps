NOTE: do not give babybrighton (guest) direct access to raw disks on
host (brighton), it breaks things terribly

% Run VirtualBox" and use the following parameters when creating
babybrighton as a virtual machine:

  - Linux/Red Hat for the Type and Version (note that if you put
  "centos" [or even "cent"] anywhere in the name, virtualbox will fill
  these automatically)

  - Choose the largest VDI, system memory (not video memory though),
  and CPUs that VirtualBox allows since we want this machine to be
  (almost) as powerful as brighton. [note that partitioning below will
  try to use entire disk so make sure to have enough disk space]

  - Leave everything else as is in the wizard (or tweak as desired),
  but, before starting the machine go to "Settings" and:

    - If you are overly aggressive with settings in the wizard,
    "invalid settings detected" will show up on your settings
    tab. Deal with these issues as directed. NOTE TO SELF: on my
    machine, 49881M is max you can assign to memory [on saopaulo, this
    number is larger, generally about 85% of host memory]

    - General/Advanced: turn on cut/paste and drag n drop bidirectionally 

    - System/Processor: crank this as high as allowed

    - Display/Remote Display: enable [you may have to install
    VirtualTools below first and then change this setting later]

    - Under Storage:

      - for the CD, choose CentOS-7-x86_64-Minimal-1511.iso as the
      image to install

    - Under Network, choose "bridged", promiscuous mode to "Allow All"
    and the MAC address to "080000000000" or something else easily
    recognizable.

  - You may wish to snapshot before installing CentOS 7 or at any
  "critical" point during this entire process. This would be the
  "preinstall" snapshot.

% After starting up babybrighton as a VM, do the following when
installing CentOS 7:

  - OPTIONAL: Since I'll be using /dev/sdb (on brighton) for most
  things, partition so that /home has 5 GiB and delete the swap
  partition entirely. Otherwise, let CentOS choose your partioning
  scheme

  - Enable full disk encryption

  - Make sure to turn "Networking" on (this option only shows after
  you're done paritioning and isn't set by default, sadly) [actually
  it may just be hidden on smaller screen resolutions]

  - Create root user with a password and "user" user as an
  administrative user w/o a password (we'll be assigning one below
  later).

  - OPTIONAL: After rebooting from install, login as "root", run
  "shutdown -h now", and take a snapshot. This is the "postinstall"
  snapshot.

  - Under settings/storage attach
  /usr/share/virtualbox/VBoxGuestAdditions.iso and boot

  - Run:

yum -y install bzip2 gcc make perl

: if below fails "rpm -e kernel-devel" and try again
rpm -i ftp://fr2.rpmfind.net/linux/centos/7.2.1511/os/x86_64/Packages/kernel-devel-3.10.0-327.el7.x86_64.rpm

mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/
cd /mnt/
export KERN_INCL=/usr/include
export KERN_DIR=/usr/src/kernels/3.10.0-327.el7.x86_64
sh VBoxLinuxAdditions.run

: you can safely ignore the Could not find the X.Org or XFree86 Window
: System, skipping. warning above

  - "shutdown -h now" and create "postguest" snapshot if desired

% OPTIONAL: if moving root, continue with bc-move-root.txt at "start
here on virtual machine"

This is "nagyerass take two", a replacement for nagios, after I've
used nagios for a while and understand what I dislike about it.

bc-run-nya-test.pl: This program will do the following:

  - log that a test is about to be run

  - run a test that is either a raw Unix command (including possibly a
  test that's part of the nagios suite) or a subroutine found in
  bc-run-nya-test.pl itself

  - a test may contain subtests, which will be run as separate forked processes

  - log the results of the test

  - print to ~/ERR the results of the test

TODO: make it an error for test results to be too old

TODO: maybe create second file from metafile (in private location) to
handle $$ cleanly

TODO: test may contain subtests

TODO: include private tests

TODO: import existing nagios tests

TODO: add ping tests since I don't have the concept of hosts vs services

TODO: allow suppress.txt to suppress running tests, not just printing results

TODO: consider moving inventory checks here?

TODO: test that weather data is fairly recent

TODO: test that drives are mounted correctly: ie, /mnt/villa and
/mnt/lobos are mounting the correct drives-- do NOT use
/mnt/villa/villa-files.txt as a test since I long term plan to copy
file lists to multiple drives (maybe use blkid and program I wrote?)

TODO: if qbittorrent is running there should be a process waiting for
it to "end" since I need to know if it crashes

TODO: check recent changes to calendar.txt to see if I mention 2018 or
otherwise add a date that seems unreasonable

TODO: confirm all doordash receipts have a link to the receipt (ie, a
receipt number) and there are no duplicate receipt numbers (and maybe
that receipt numbers are in numerical order by date)

TODO: make sure claim numbers in medical database are unique (and in
order of date?)

TODO: alert if my Ally bank balance falls below $15K, where Ally gives
me a much lower interest rate

TODO: don't run tests if CPU it too low

TODO: getmail log recency (existing perl script)

TODO: fix-it scripts when something goes wrong

TODO: REMINDER: can write tests even before nagyerass goes into production

TODO: installed cron file should never be empty (+ should be certain
min size?)

TODO: see also ../NAGIOS/TODO and perhaps merge here

TODO: categories in bankstatements, cashstatements,
credcardstatements2 should be from a fixed list, and some should not
be used after a given date

TODO: any entries that have order number (such as shipt purchases)
should have unique ones

TODO: saved-messages should never contain certain types of messages,
such as uptimerobot notifications

TODO: confirm that fixed monthly payments are actually constant and
occur only once a month (including rent/mortgage/etc)

TODO: all refnum for instacard should be exactly five letters long in db

TODO: git status

TODO: twitch streams in email, on youtube and downloaded should
roughly match in terms of time, number, length, etc

TODO: i should have PDF version of all doordash receipts

TODO: /usr/local/etc/tasks/ and subdirs should have no .new files

TODO: in the ~/TODAY directory, there should be no files from the future (or older than 19-whatever)

TODO: all doordash/postmates/etc orders should have refnum field nonempty

TODO: doordash order numbers (and others?) should be in numerical
order by date (if not, I've probably confused two otherwise identical
orders), should also be unique

TODO: all emails in BC-WP-.... should follow pattern

TODO: all claim numbers in medical db should be unique

TODO: for ebay purchases, refnum should be item number, item number
must appear in comments, comments must contain phrase "this charge
will appear on your credit card as [x]", and the merchant must match x

TODO: in my EDABIT and SKYFIELD folders, there should be no 'new' messages

TODO: refnums in the db should not have newlines

This is "nagyerass take two", a replacement for nagios, after I've
used nagios for a while and understand what I dislike about it.

bc-run-nya-test.pl: This program will do the following:

  - log that a test is about to be run

  - run a test that is either a raw Unix command (including possibly a
  test that's part of the nagios suite) or a subroutine found in
  bc-run-nya-test.pl itself

  - a test may contain subtests, which will be run as separate forked processes

  - log the results of the test

  - print to ~/ERR the results of the test

TODO: make it an error for test results to be too old

TODO: maybe create second file from metafile (in private location) to
handle $$ cleanly

TODO: test may contain subtests

TODO: include private tests

TODO: import existing nagios tests

TODO: add ping tests since I don't have the concept of hosts vs services

TODO: allow suppress.txt to suppress running tests, not just printing results

TODO: consider moving inventory checks here?

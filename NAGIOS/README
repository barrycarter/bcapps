Goal: Setup a version of nagios that uses my programs to handle alerts, 
fixes, etc. Run as:

sudo rm ~/ERR/nagios.*.err;
sudo pkill nagios; sudo nagios ~/BCGIT/NAGIOS/nagios.cfg &

Also attempts to "fix" what I percieve as design flaws in nagios

To force nagios to run a command instantly, see http://old.nagios.org/developerinfo/externalcommands/commandlist.php (examples below)

echo "["`date +%s`"]" "SCHEDULE_FORCED_HOST_CHECK;bcmac;"`date +%s` >> /var/nagios/rw/nagios.cmd

echo "["`date +%s`"]" "SCHEDULE_FORCED_HOST_SVC_CHECKS;localhost;"`date +%s` >> /var/nagios/rw/nagios.cmd

Created these views solely to avoid quoting problems in 'badbank' test

CREATE VIEW badbank AS SELECT * FROM bankstatements WHERE
(recognized IS NULL OR recognized!='YES') AND amount<0 AND date>='2013-07-01';

CREATE VIEW badbankcat AS SELECT * FROM bankstatements WHERE
 (category IS NULL OR category="") AND amount<0 AND date>="2013-09-01";

The following command shows Internet outages to report to Comcast:

tac /var/nagios/nagios.log | fgrep -i 'google;DOWN;HARD' | less

(there aren't many, but the 5 minute check interval means 50 minutes
of outages before this kicks in)

tac /var/nagios/nagios.log | fgrep -i 'google;DOWN;soft;5' | less

(above for 25m worth of outages; using "soft;1" gives false positives,
but even "soft;2" is good for reporting to Comcast)

Known issues as of 11 Mar 2018:

  - Both the MySQL and SQLite3 versions of the astronomical
  conjunctions database are missing or broken, which affects:

    - http://astro.db.mysql.barrycarter.info/

    - many pages linked from http://search.astro.barrycarter.info/

    - and probably more

  - http://test.barrycarter.info/ASTRO/ is missing in its
  entirety. This contained:

    - List of all conjunctions in CSV(?) format

  -
  http://wordpress.barrycarter.org/index.php/voronoi-temperature-map/
  is broken; the page itself is on bcinfo4, but its broken because
  http://data.barrycarter.info/current-voronoi.kmz is the KML file;
  analogous situation with
  http://wordpress.barrycarter.org/index.php/delaunay-temperature-map/; consider running both of these directly on bcinfo4 as possible fix

  - Use log files to find which bcinfo3 pages were most popular
  (perhaps excluding bots) and prioritize fixing those

  - Restore either the SQLite3 or MySQL version of the gocomics
  comments database

  - Resume scraping comments from gocomics regularly, if possible
  (however, format has changed, so this may no longer be possible)

  - For any of these, consider moving to bcinfo4 or an "app container"
  like thing from Amazon S3 or similar

  - Have bcinfo3 create a daily filelist that I backup locally to help
  w/ potential future crashes

  - If doing above, consider adding filelist to bc-rev-search.pl

  - See if I'm still using PHP anywhere, (and uninstall it if not?)

  - Autorotate web logs, currently have monthly scheduled event to do
  so manually

  - Move away from SQLite3 and make all dbs MySQL; however, note that
  MySQL appears more "crashy" and tends to corrupt tables more(?)

  - See if I still use the 'madis' MySQL table, and stop updating it
  (and delete it) if not

  - Look at errors in web log error file to see if anything is wrong
  (or make minor corrections if all errors are "cosmetic")

  - Does bcinfo3 receive mail (either from local programs or via
  SMTP), and, if so, where does it/should it go? [at one point, I set
  up /var/pmail for this, but that appears to be long gone]

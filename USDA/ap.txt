Section 1
===================================================================================

The following is a definition of:  Average Price Data (AP)

Survey Description:  Average consumer prices are calculated for household
fuel, motor fuel, and food items from prices collected for the Consumer
Price Index (CPI).  Average prices are best used to measure the price level
in a particular month, not to measure price change over time.  It is more
appropriate to use the CU or CW and its individual item indexes to measure
price change.

Prices, except for electricity, are collected monthly by BLS representatives
in the 85 urban areas priced for the CPI.  Electricity prices are collected
for the BLS for the same 85 areas on a monthly basis by the Department of
Energy using mail questionnaires.  All fuel prices include applicable
Federal, State, and local taxes; prices for natural gas and electricity also
include fuel and purchased gas adjustments.

Summary Data Available:  Average consumer prices for household fuel and
motor fuel are available for the U.S. city average, 28 urban areas, four
regions, and 16 region/size class groupings.

Average consumer prices for food are available for the U.S. city average and
four regions.

Monthly data are available for up to six household fuel categories, six
motor fuel categories, and 104 food categories.

Frequency of Observations:  All data are monthly; annual averages are not
available.

Data Characteristics:  Average prices are stored to three decimal places.

Updating Schedule:  Updates become available near the 15th of the month
following the reference month.

Section 3
=================================================================================
The definition of a time series, its relationship to and the interrelationship
among series, data and mapping files is detailed below:

A time series refers to a set of data observed over an extended period of time
over consistent time intervals (i.e. monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, annually).  
BLS time series data are typically produced at monthly intervals and represent data 
ranging from a specific consumer item in a specific geographical area whose price 
is gathered monthly to a category of worker in a specific industry whose employment
rate is being recorded monthly, etc.

The FTP files are organized such that data users are provided with the following
set of files to use in their efforts to interpret data files:

a)  a series file (only one series file per survey)
b)  mapping files
c)  data files

The series file contains a set of codes which, together, compose a series 
identification code that serves to uniquely identify a single time series.  
Additionally, the series file also contains the following series-level information:

a) the period and year corresponding to the first data observation 
b) the period and year corresponding to the most recent data observation. 

The mapping files are definition files that contain explanatory text descriptions
that correspond to each of the various codes contained within each series
identification code.

The data file contains one line of data for each observation period pertaining to a
specific time series.  Each line contains a reference to the following:

a) a series identification code
b) year in which data is observed
c) period for which data is observed (M13, Q05, and S03 indicate annual averages)
d) value
e) footnote code (if available)

File Structure and Format: The following represents the file format used to define
ap.series.  Note the Field Numbers are for reference only; they do not exist in the
database.  Data files are in ASCII text format.  Data elements are separated by 
spaces; the first record of each file contains the column headers for the data 
elements stored in each field.  Each record ends with a new line character. 

Field #/Data Element	Length		Value(Example)		

1.  series_id		  17		APU0000701111

2.  area_code		   4		A100

3.  item_code		   7		712211

4.  begin_year		   4		1980

5.  begin_period	   3		M01		
				
6.  end_year		   4		2002		

7.  end_period		   3		M02	
					

The series_id (APU0000701111) can be broken out into:

Code					Value(Example)

survey abbreviation	=		AP
seasonal(code)		=		U
area_code		=		0000
item_code		=		701111
==================================================================================
Section 5
==================================================================================
File Structure and Format: The following represents the file format used to define
each data file.  Note that the field numbers are for reference only; they do not 
exist in the database.  Data files are in ASCII text format.  Data elements are 
separated by spaces; the first record of each file contains the column headers for 
the data elements stored in each field.  Each record ends with a new line character.  

The ap.data file is partitioned into four separate files:  

	1.  ap.data.0.Current		= All current year-to-date data
	2.  ap.data.1.HouseholdFuels	= All household fuel (fuel oil,
					  utility gas, electricity) data
	3.  ap.data.2.Gasoline		= All gasoline data
	4.  ap.data.3.Food		= All food data

Both of the above data files have the following format:

Field #/Data Element	Length		Value(Example)		

1. series_id		  17		APU0000701111

2. year			   4		1980	

3. period		   3		M01		

4. value		  12      	0.238	
				 

5. footnote_codes	  10		It varies
				

The series_id (APU0000701111) can be broken out into:

Code					Value(Example)

survey abbreviation	=		AP
seasonal(code)		=		U
area_code		=		0000
item_code		=		701111

Section 6
============================================================================
File Structure and Format:  The following represents the file format used to define
each mapping file. Note that the field numbers are for reference only; they do not
exist in the database.  Mapping files are in ASCII text format.  Data elements are
separated by tabs; the first record of each file contains the column headers for the
data elements stored in each field.  Each record ends with a new line character. 

File Name:  ap.area
